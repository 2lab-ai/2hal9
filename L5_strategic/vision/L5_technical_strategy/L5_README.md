- L5_PHASE2_STRATEGIC_PLAN.md

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **Technical Vision** - Where we're going technically
- **Platform Strategy** - Build vs buy vs partner
- **Architecture Evolution** - Planned growth paths
- **Technology Selection** - Strategic tech choices
- **Innovation Pipeline** - R&D priorities

## Strategic Technical Decisions

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Rust for performance and safety
- **Architecture**: Hierarchical abstraction layers
- **Platform**: Cloud-native, Kubernetes-ready
- **AI Framework**: Multi-model orchestration
- **Data Layer**: Distributed, eventually consistent

### Technical Principles
1. **Hierarchical Abstraction** - Our core innovation
2. **Distributed First** - Built for scale
3. **API-Driven** - Everything has an API
4. **Observable** - Metrics at every layer
5. **Evolutionary** - Designed to grow

## What NOT to Expect

- **Business Context**: [L7 Business](../../../../L7_business/)
- **Architecture Details**: [L4 Tactical](../../../../L4_tactical/)
- **Executive Summary**: [L6 Executive](../../../../L6_executive/)

## Technical Strategy Framework

At L5, we make decisions about:
- **Platform Architecture** - Overall system design
- **Technology Stack** - Languages, frameworks, tools
- **Scalability Strategy** - How to handle growth
- **Innovation Areas** - Where to invest R&D
- **Technical Debt** - What to refactor when

## Time Horizons

L5 planning operates on:
- **6 months** - Tactical technical decisions
- **2 years** - Strategic platform evolution
- **5 years** - Technology paradigm shifts

## Technical Metrics

Key indicators at L5:
- **Architecture Fitness** - How well design serves needs
- **Technical Velocity** - Speed of innovation
- **Platform Scalability** - Growth capacity
- **Tech Debt Ratio** - Health of codebase
- **Innovation Index** - R&D output

## Contributing to L5

To contribute at this level:
1. Think platform, not features
2. Consider 2-5 year impact
3. Balance innovation with stability
4. Design for scale
5. Document strategic rationale

## The L5 Mindset

When reading L5 documents:
- Think systems, not components
- Consider evolution, not just current state
- Balance ideal with practical
- Plan for scale from day one
- Design for change
