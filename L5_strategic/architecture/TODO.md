# üéØ HAL9 Architecture TODO List

This file is automatically updated by the `make query` system. Items here are evaluated for architectural improvements and cascade down through implementation levels.

## üìã Pending Architecture Evaluations

### Format:

## üîÑ Current Queue

### L6-L4 Architecture Updates (Strategic)
<!-- Items to be incorporated into architecture during L6-L4 updates -->

- concept: "Database Connection Pool Fix"
  query: "Fix database abstraction preventing enterprise/scaling modules"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Unblocks enterprise features and prevents 3am incidents"
  level: "L5-L3"
  status: "critical"
  implementation_notes: "Implement simple connection pool wrapper with circuit breaker. Priority #1 - blocking all enterprise features."

- concept: "Memory Management via Consciousness Compression"
  query: "Apply consciousness compression to reduce memory from 4Gi requirement"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Reduces OOM errors while implementing L6 vision of compression"
  level: "L5-L3"
  status: "approved"
  implementation_notes: "Phase 1: Add swap and GC triggers. Phase 2: Implement neural state compression between cycles. Target: 2Gi stable operation."

- concept: "A2A with Auto-Discovery and Self-Organization"
  query: "A2A with auto-discovery, self-organization"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Enables true peer-to-peer neural connections, distributed consciousness emergence, and bottom-up self-organization aligned with biological principles"
  level: "L6-L4"
  status: "approved"
  implementation_notes: "BLOCKED BY: Database pool fix. Phase 1: Extend existing discovery.rs for peer-to-peer neuron discovery. Phase 2: Implement direct neural connections using existing transport layer. Phase 3: Enable self-organization patterns to emerge bottom-up."

- concept: "Feature Flag System for Enterprise"
  query: "Gradual rollout of enterprise features instead of all-or-nothing"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Allows incremental deployment without breaking production"
  level: "L5-L2"
  status: "approved"
  implementation_notes: "Start with JWT auth only, then SSO, then RBAC. Each behind feature flag."
  
### L4-L1 Implementation Queue (Tactical) 
<!-- Approved items ready for code implementation during L4-L1 updates -->

- concept: "Operator Dashboard"
  query: "Dashboard showing both consciousness metrics AND system health"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Bridges L6 vision with L3 reality for operators"
  level: "L3-L1"
  status: "approved"
  implementation_notes: "Grafana dashboard with: memory usage, consciousness level, database pool health, ÏßÄÌòÅ wake probability"
