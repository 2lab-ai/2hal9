echo "ðŸŒŸ Enhanced Features:"
echo "  âœ“ Context memory (remembers last 10 interactions)"
echo "  âœ“ Layer-specific personality traits"
echo "  âœ“ Consciousness-aware responses for higher layers"
echo "  âœ“ Dynamic response variance (Â±20% delay)"
echo "  âœ“ Emergence indicators when appropriate"

echo "ðŸ’¡ To see this in action:"
echo "  1. Set CLAUDE_MODE=mock in your environment"
echo "  2. Run: cargo run --release --bin hal9-server"
echo "  3. Send requests to different layer endpoints"
echo "  4. Observe sophisticated, context-aware responses"
