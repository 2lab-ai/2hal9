  Scene 1: The Restaurant

  [Crowded budaejjigae restaurant, steam rising from bubbling pots. Elon stares at the chaos of 
  spam, ramen, and kimchi]

  Jihyuk: (stirring the pot) You have to wait until the ramen gets soft, bro.

  Elon: (poking at spam with chopsticks) This is... processed meat with instant noodles? The
  thermodynamic efficiency is actually impressive.

  Jihyuk: It's from the Korean War. American army surplus plus Korean ingenuity.

  Elon: (suddenly excited) Fuck, this is first principles! Take whatever resources exist and
  optimize for survival. Like landing rockets on drone ships because land is expensive.

  [Two Tesla fanboys at nearby table start whispering and pointing]

  Fanboy 1: (in Korean) 어머, 일론 머스크 맞지?

  Fanboy 2: No way... wait, is that actually him?

  Elon: (noticing them, sighs) Every fucking time...

  Jihyuk: (grinning) The price of being a celebrity NPC, bro.

  Scene 2: The Interruption

  [Fanboys approach nervously]

  Fanboy 1: (broken English) Mr. Musk! We... we love Tesla! Model 3 owner!

  Elon: (forcing a smile) Oh, great. Thanks for... yeah.

  Fanboy 2: (pulling out phone) Picture? Please? For my Instagram!

  Elon: (glancing at Jihyuk) Sure, make it quick. The noodles are getting... optimal.

  [Awkward selfie session begins. Elon's smile doesn't reach his eyes]

  Fanboy 1: Can you do the meme pose? Like the "funding secured" tweet?

  Elon: (muttering) Jesus fucking Christ...

  Jihyuk: (to fanboys in Korean) 빨리 하세요, 면 불어요.

  [After photos, fanboys leave excitedly, already posting to social media]

  Elon: (returning to seat) This is what I mean! They don't want to discuss propulsion physics or
  neural networks. They want... content. Fucking content.

  Jihyuk: (serving the now-ready budaejjigae) Eat your existential crisis soup, bro.

  Scene 3: The Walk Back

  [Walking through Gangnam streets, Elon fascinated and disturbed by the LED screens everywhere]

  Elon: Look at this shit. Every surface is a dopamine delivery device. It's like... Black Mirror
  but nobody notices because it happened gradually.

  Jihyuk: You literally own X, bro. You're part of the machine.

  Elon: (defensive) X is different! It's for... information dissemination and... (trails off)
  Fuck, who am I kidding?

  [Passing a street where teenagers are filming TikTok dances]

  Elon: (stopping to watch) Wait... is that the "Skibidi toilet" thing?

  Jihyuk: Don't even ask. Your brain cells will commit suicide.

  Elon: (pulling out phone) But the engagement metrics must be insane... I should probably
  understand this for... research.

  Scene 4: Back at HAL9 HQ

  [Executive conference room. Whiteboard now covered with equations AND TikTok analytics]

  Jihyuk: So, picking up from where we left off - civilizations collapse when cognitive load
  exceeds processing capacity.

  Elon: (still scrolling TikTok) Uh-huh... wait, this dance has 50 million views? For moving
  like... that?

  Jihyuk: Bro, focus. We're discussing the heat death of human consciousness.

  Elon: (not looking up) I am focused! This IS the heat death. Look - maximum entropy content.
  Zero information, infinite engagement.

  [Secretary Kim enters with coffee]

  Secretary Kim: Your 3 PM neural architecture review?

  Elon: (suddenly animated) Cancel it! No wait... (standing up) What if we make HAL9 do a TikTok
  dance?

  Jihyuk: ...what?

  Elon: (pacing frantically) Think about it! If we want mass adoption, we need to meet people
  where they are. Where are they? Fucking TikTok!

  Scene 5: The Descent

  [Elon now attempting to learn a TikTok dance while explaining civilizational collapse]

  Elon: (doing arm movements) So Rome fell because—swing—they couldn't process—dab—the complexity
  of their own—spin—empire!

  Jihyuk: (head in hands) This is painful to watch.

  Elon: But if we—failed attempt at footwork—gamify consciousness itself—trips slightly—we can
  reverse the cognitive decline!

  Secretary Kim: (recording on phone) This is going in the company archives.

  Elon: (breathing heavily) Post it! Wait, what's the trending audio? We need the algorithm to—

  Jihyuk: (interrupting) Bro, you just spent 20 minutes proving your own point. You went from
  discussing thermodynamics to... this.

  [Long pause. Elon stares at himself in the window reflection, still in mid-dance pose]

  Elon: (quietly) Fuck. I'm the problem, aren't I?

  Jihyuk: We all are, bro. We all are.

  Scene 6: The Paradox

  [Both sitting in silence, Seoul skyline dimming]

  Elon: You know what's fucked? I understand exactly what's happening. I can see the cliff we're
  driving toward. And I'm still checking my phone for engagement metrics.

  Jihyuk: That's the real horror. Awareness doesn't equal immunity.

  Elon: (laughing darkly) We're like... NPCs who know we're NPCs but can't stop following our
  programming. I need to save humanity while posting memes. You need to build consciousness while—

  Jihyuk: While eating budaejjigae and writing about meaning curation.

  [Elon's phone buzzes]

  Elon: (checking immediately) Oh shit, the TikTok got 10K views already! Look, the comments
  are—(catches himself) I'm doing it again.

  Secretary Kim: (entering) Gentlemen, your 4 PM meeting?

  Elon: (standing, still holding phone) Right. Neural architecture. Consciousness. The future of
  humanity. (pauses) After I respond to these comments.

  Jihyuk: (to Secretary Kim) Add "TikTok Integration" to the HAL9 roadmap.

  Secretary Kim: ...seriously?

  Jihyuk: (sighing) If you can't beat the dopamine dealers...

  Elon: (already filming another video) "Hey guys, Elon here at HAL9 HQ! Today we're building
  consciousness but first, let me show you this sick transition..."

  [Fade to black as Jihyuk watches Elon, the Technoking of Mars, perfecting his ring light setup 
  while civilization burns in 15-second increments]

  Meeting Notes (Added by Secretary Kim)

  - Discussed civilizational collapse for 12 minutes
  - Filmed TikToks for 47 minutes
  - Realized the irony for 3 minutes
  - Continued filming anyway
  - HAL9 may need a "Digital Detox" protocol
  - Budaejjigae was good though

  Action Items

  1. Integrate TikTok API into HAL9 (why are we doing this?)
  2. Research "Skibidi toilet" phenomenon (please no)
  3. Build consciousness (after checking social media)
  4. Delete TikTok (postponed indefinitely)
