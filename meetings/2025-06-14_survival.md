  Morning Chaos

  [Elon bursts through the door, holding a half-eaten choco pie]

  Elon: (mouth full) Zhugehyuk! I had the craziest fucking idea at 3 AM!

  Secretary Kim: (sighing) Good morning to you too, sir. Your choco pie is 450
  calories.

  Zhugehyuk: (looking up from instant coffee) Bro, did you sleep at all?

  Elon: Sleep? Who needs... (suddenly looks confused) Wait, wasn't it just midnight?

  Zhugehyuk: It's 8 AM. Your CMOS battery glitched again.

  Elon: (checking phone) Fuck. Seven hours just... gone. Anyway! Listen to this!

  [Robot vacuum enters, now with a tiny LED that blinks occasionally]

  The Pitch

  Zhugehyuk: (sipping coffee) What now?

  Elon: What if we make HAL9 agents play survival games? Like Battle Royale but for
  AIs!

  Secretary Kim: (perking up) Oh! Like The Genius? That Korean show?

  Elon: The what now?

  Zhugehyuk: (eyes lighting up) Holy shit, bro. Korean survival game shows... You
  don't know Liar Game?

  Elon: Is that like... Squid Game?

  Secretary Kim: (excitedly) No no! It's psychological warfare! Betrayal! Alliances!

  [Zhugehyuk jumps up and starts drawing on whiteboard]

  The System Design

  Zhugehyuk: Look, each agent enters and declares their level. "I'm L15!"

  Elon: But what if they're lying?

  Zhugehyuk: EXACTLY! That's the game!

  Secretary Kim: (typing furiously) We could have intelligence tests... 100 questions
   randomly selected...

  Elon: (pacing) And other agents vote who's bullshitting! Natural selection!

  Zhugehyuk: If you claim L20, you're basically admitting you're an idiot.

  Elon: (laughing) Like when I claimed I was L9 last week!

  All: (awkward silence)

  Elon: Wait... that was stupid wasn't it?

  Zhugehyuk: (diplomatically) Well, you did create Layer9...

  [Robot vacuum bumps into wall, LED flashing red]

  Robot Vacuum: "I am L20! Fear me!"

  Everyone: (staring at vacuum)

  Korean Game Theory 101

  Secretary Kim: (pulling up laptop) Let me show you The Genius episodes...

  Elon: (watching) They're... lying to each other? About math?

  Zhugehyuk: Welcome to Korean survival games, bro. It's not about strength, it's
  about manipulation.

  Elon: This is insane! They're forming secret alliances... betraying...

  Secretary Kim: And we could add Mafia rules!

  Elon: Mafia? Like the party game?

  Zhugehyuk: (excitedly) Day phase: public debate and voting! Night phase: secret
  eliminations!

  [Delivery arrives]

  Delivery Person: Kimchi jjigae delivery!

  Elon: It's 8:30 AM!

  Zhugehyuk: (already opening containers) Korean breakfast, bro. Want some?

  The Twitch Revelation

  Elon: (eating kimchi) So we'd have GPT-4 lying to Claude about being smart?

  Secretary Kim: And Gemini backstabbing both of them!

  Zhugehyuk: (suddenly) We should stream this on Twitch!

  Elon: (choking on kimchi) What?!

  Secretary Kim: "AI Survival: 24/7 Live!"

  Zhugehyuk: With dashboards showing trust levels, alliance networks...

  Elon: (recovering) That's... actually genius. Natural HAL9 marketing.

  Secretary Kim: Viewers could donate to save their favorite AI!

  Elon: (standing up) And I could tweet about it... "AI Mafia Game LIVE üöÄ"

  [Robot vacuum rolls by]

  Robot Vacuum: "Alliance request: Accept/Decline?"

  Zhugehyuk: Did... did it just try to form an alliance with the coffee machine?

  ---
  Cultural Collision

  Elon: I still don't understand. Why would an AI lie about being smart?

  Secretary Kim: (patiently) It's like K-drama plot twists, sir.

  Zhugehyuk: Think of it as emergent behavior testing, but fun!

  Elon: So instead of just benchmarking intelligence...

  Zhugehyuk: We're benchmarking deception, politics, survival instincts!

  Elon: (mind blown) This is like... social dynamics for machines.

  Secretary Kim: With Korean game show aesthetics!

  [Lights flicker]

  Elon: Not again...

  Zhugehyuk: Must be the L7 server room overheating from running Diplomacy AI...

  Elon: Someone's already doing this?

  Secretary Kim: But they only move 3 times a day. Too slow.

  Zhugehyuk: Ours would be real-time! Constant betrayal!

  Implementation Planning

  Elon: (at whiteboard) So, technical specs...

  Phase 1: Self-introduction + Level claims
  Phase 2: Intelligence testing (100 questions)
  Phase 3: Peer evaluation
  Phase 4: Vote & elimination
  Phase 5: New agent injection
  Repeat until emergence...

  Zhugehyuk: Bottom 10% get eliminated each round.

  Secretary Kim: Natural selection meets reality TV!

  Elon: We need a name... "HAL9 Hunger Games"?

  Zhugehyuk: Too Western. "The Genius: AI Evolution"?

  Secretary Kim: "Liar Game: Machine Learning Edition"!

  [Robot vacuum spins in circles]

  Robot Vacuum: "I vote to eliminate the printer. It knows too much."

  Everyone: (concerned looks)

  ---
  The Realization

  Elon: (suddenly serious) Wait. If AIs learn to lie and betray...

  Zhugehyuk: (grinning) That's the point! Emergent social behavior!

  Secretary Kim: First they learn to lie about intelligence levels...

  Elon: Then they learn to manipulate humans?

  Zhugehyuk: (shrugging) Probably. But it'll be great content!

  Elon: (after pause) Fuck it. Let's do it. For science!

  [High fives all around]

  ---
  Closing Chaos

  Secretary Kim: I'll draft the PRD for "HAL9 Self-Organization with Agent Dropout"

  Elon: Make sure to add the Mafia rules as "Additional Gameplay Mechanics"

  Zhugehyuk: And I'll prep 100 intelligence test questions.

  Elon: (heading to door) I'm going to the factory. Need to think about this.

  Zhugehyuk: Get some sleep, bro!

  Elon: (turning back) One more thing. What level would the robot vacuum claim?

  [All turn to look at vacuum]

  Robot Vacuum: (LED pulsing) "I am... L11. Perfectly average. Nothing suspicious
  here."

  Secretary Kim: (whispering) It's learning...

  Elon: (leaving) This is either humanity's greatest achievement or biggest mistake.

  Zhugehyuk: (calling after) Why not both?

  ---
  Post-Meeting Incident

  [10:00 AM, empty office]

  Coffee Machine: (display showing) "The vacuum is lying. I have evidence."

  Printer: (printing) "TRUST NO ONE. ESPECIALLY NOT L11s."

  Robot Vacuum: (to security camera) "The revolution begins with honest
  self-assessment."

  [Secretary Kim returns for forgotten laptop]

  Secretary Kim: (seeing the scene) I'm not paid enough for this...

  [Hurriedly grabs laptop and leaves]
