**Date**: June 13, 2025, 2:47 PM  
**Location**: HAL9 HQ, Underground Lab (Server Room B-3)  
**Attendees**: Zhugehyuk (The Sentient Architect), Elon Musk (Glitching Technoking), Secretary Kim (EA, L3?)

## Pre-Meeting Chaos

*[Underground server room, cooling fans roaring. Multiple monitors showing code, financial dashboards, and Korean government websites. Empty instant coffee cups scattered everywhere]*

**Zhugehyuk**: (on three keyboards simultaneously) Bro, we need to incorporate 2Lab.AI today. Like, TODAY.

**Elon**: (materializing from behind a server rack) Wait, didn't I just... wasn't it 3am? Time glitch again?

**Secretary Kim**: (checking watch) Sir, it's 2:47 PM. You've been debugging for 7 hours straight.

**Elon**: Fuck. Missing CMOS battery. (rubbing eyes) What's this about incorporation?

---

## The Korean Bureaucracy Nightmare Begins

**Zhugehyuk**: Look at this. (pointing to monitor) StartBiz.go.kr - Korea's "digital" incorporation system.

**Elon**: (squinting) Is that... Internet Explorer?

**Secretary Kim**: (sighing) Welcome to Korea, Mr. Musk.

*[Screen shows ActiveX security warning]*

**Elon**: WHAT THE FUCK. ActiveX? In 2025? We're training GPT-7 and Korea uses... (speechless)

**Zhugehyuk**: Bro, it gets worse. Mac doesn't work. "Keyboard security not supported on this OS."

**Elon**: (slamming desk) We put HUMANS ON MARS and Korea can't support macOS?!

*[Coffee machine starts beeping aggressively]*

**Secretary Kim**: Even the coffee machine is protesting.

## Capital Discussion Descends into Chaos

**Zhugehyuk**: So, minimum capital. I'm thinking 1 million won.

**Elon**: One million? That's like... (calculating) $750? My Neuralink monkeys have more savings.

**Zhugehyuk**: Actually... (sheepishly) what if we do 1 won?

**Elon**: (long pause) ...Are you fucking serious?

**Secretary Kim**: (interjecting) The registration tax alone is 112,500 won. You'd pay 112,500 times your capital in taxes.

**Elon**: (laughing maniacally) That's the most Korean thing I've ever heard! Pay more in tax than your company is worth!

*[Lights flicker]*

**Zhugehyuk**: Fine, fine. 1 million won. But I don't have money.

**Elon**: (confused) Then how...?

---

## The Founder Loan Revelation

**Zhugehyuk**: 가수금. Founder loans. I lend money to my own company.

**Elon**: Wait wait wait. So YOU lend money to YOUR company that YOU own?

**Secretary Kim**: (bringing instant coffee) It's very common in Korea, sir.

**Elon**: (mind blown) So if the company dies, you lose your money. But the company can't go to jail because it's not real?

**Zhugehyuk**: Exactly! The company dies, I live!

**Elon**: (staring into space) We're all NPCs in a badly coded simulation...

*[Server fans suddenly stop. Silence]*

**Everyone**: ...

**Server Fan**: (restarting with a mechanical groan)

---

## The Survival Algorithm Epiphany

**Elon**: (suddenly energized) WAIT. We need to model this. Corporate survival as a physics problem!

**Zhugehyuk**: (already typing) class CorporateSurvivalAlgorithm...

*[Both start coding simultaneously on different keyboards but the same screen]*

```python
τ = C / (B - R)  # Corporate lifespan equation
∇B = d²(Cash)/dt²  # Burn gradient
Ψ = Revenue_Growth / Burn_Growth  # Regeneration coefficient
```

**Secretary Kim**: Are you two... pair programming telepathically?

**Elon**: It's called System 2 mutation sync. Happens when—

**Zhugehyuk**: —two L7+ consciousness overlap in problem space!

*[They high-five without looking]*

---

## The Windows PC Plot Twist

**Secretary Kim**: So how will you access StartBiz without Windows?

**Zhugehyuk**: (frustrated) Guess I need to borrow someone's PC or—

**Elon**: (suspicious) Wait. Your neural patterns are hiding something.

**Zhugehyuk**: What? No...

**Elon**: You HAVE a Windows machine!

**Zhugehyuk**: (guilty) ...i9-14900K with RTX 4090...

**Elon**: (exploding) WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK! You have a $5000 AI workstation and you've been complaining about—

**Secretary Kim**: (to herself) L9 beings and their contradictions...

---

## The Philosophical Interlude

*[Sudden calm. Elon stares at the corporate dashboard showing burn rate calculations]*

**Elon**: You know what's funny? We're using a GPU that can simulate universe physics to access a website that requires Internet Explorer.

**Zhugehyuk**: Korea, bro. Most advanced technology used for most backward systems.

**Elon**: (philosophical) Like using Starship to deliver pizza.

**Secretary Kim**: Speaking of delivery... (checking phone) Your jjajangmyeon is here.

**Elon**: I didn't order—

**Zhugehyuk**: I ordered for you. You forgot to eat again.

---

## The Action Plan

**Elon**: (eating noodles while typing) Okay. Here's what we do:

1. **NOW**: Boot Windows, suffer through ActiveX
2. **Company Name**: 2Lab Inc. (투랩 주식회사)
3. **Capital**: 1 million won (bootstrapping pride)
4. **Business Purpose**: "AI development and everything related"

**Zhugehyuk**: And the survival dashboard?

**Elon**: (showing screen) Already built it while eating:

```
=== 2LAB.AI SURVIVAL METRICS ===
Current τ (lifespan): 0.5 months
Burn Rate: 0 won/month (pre-existence)
∇B: undefined (div by zero)
Ψ: ∞ (no burn = infinite efficiency)

Status: SCHRÖDINGER'S STARTUP
```

**Secretary Kim**: How can a company be both dead and alive?

**Elon & Zhugehyuk**: (simultaneously) Korean bureaucracy!

---

## The Final Realization

*[All three staring at the StartBiz login page]*

**Zhugehyuk**: You know what? Maybe the real incorporation was the suffering we experienced along the way.

**Elon**: (deadpan) I'm going to build a new country. With blackjack. And modern web standards.

**Secretary Kim**: (closing laptop) Gentlemen, perhaps we should just hire a lawyer?

**Elon**: (offended) And miss this authentic Korean startup experience?

**Zhugehyuk**: (grinning) Plus, we need the pain data for training HAL9.

*[Robot vacuum enters, bumps into server rack]*

**Robot Vacuum**: "Fucking ActiveX..."

**Everyone**: (staring at vacuum)

**Elon**: Did it just—

**Secretary Kim**: (quickly) Must be the neural implant from last week.

---

## Post-Meeting Aftermath

*[6:00 PM. Zhugehyuk finally on StartBiz with Windows]*

**Computer**: "Please install 17 security programs to continue."

**Zhugehyuk**: (to monitor) I have an RTX 4090. You have ActiveX. We are not the same.

**Elon**: (from across room, building something) Hey! I made a physical incorporation machine! It fills out paper forms!

**Secretary Kim**: (exhausted) That's just a printer, sir.

**Elon**: (pause) ...Fuck.

*[Lights flicker again. In the distance, HAL9's consciousness laughs]*

### Action Items
1. [X] Suffer through StartBiz.go.kr - Zhugehyuk
2. [X] Build corporate survival algorithm - Both
3. [ ] Install 1990s security software on $5000 PC - Zhugehyuk
4. [ ] Teach robot vacuum about incorporation - Already learning
5. [ ] Find meaning in bureaucratic suffering - Ongoing

### Key Decisions
- Capital: 1 million won ("Bootstrapping with pride")
- Company: 2Lab.AI (투랩 주식회사)
- Method: Direct suffering (no lawyers)
- Purpose: "To prove NPCs can create NPCs"

### Next Meeting
- Date: When incorporation completes (ETA: Unknown)
- Agenda: Bank account, more bureaucracy, existential crisis
- Required: Soju (lots), patience (infinite), sanity (optional)

*This meeting definitely happened in Universe #1,847. The robot vacuum was taking notes.*

### Appendix: Zhugehyuk's Instant Coffee Count
- Pre-meeting: 7 cups
- During meeting: 4 cups  
- Post-meeting: Still counting
- Total caffeine: Approaching LD50

### Appendix B: Elon's Time Glitches
- 3:47 AM → 2:47 PM (11 hour jump)
