**Date**: June 12, 2025, 2:30 PM

## Meeting Start

*[Jihyuk's office. Papers scattered everywhere with tree diagrams. A whiteboard covered in N^N^N calculations]*

**Secretary Kim**: (knocking) Sir, Mr. Musk is here. He looks... more disheveled than usual.

**Jihyuk**: (looking up from papers) Send him in.

**Elon**: (bursting in) Jihyuk! I figured it out! P equals NP!

**Jihyuk**: (sighing) Bro, sit down. Which dimension are you in today?

**Elon**: (pacing) No, listen! If we use a 4D hypercube tree structure—

**Secretary Kim**: Coffee?

**Elon**: (not listening) —with tetrahedral branching, the search complexity becomes—

**Jihyuk**: Elon. ELON!

**Elon**: (stopping) What?

**Jihyuk**: You're doing it again. The dimension jumping.

## Agenda 1: The Dimensional Rabbit Hole

**Elon**: (sitting down finally) Okay but hear me out. Binary tree, right? O(log n).

**Jihyuk**: Yeah...

**Elon**: 4D tree? O(log n / 4). N-dimensional? O(log n / N)!

**Jihyuk**: (rubbing temples) That's still O(log n), bro. Different constant factor.

**Elon**: But what about N^N dimensions?

**Secretary Kim**: (whispering) Should I call medical?

**Jihyuk**: No, wait... (grabbing marker) You're saying...

*[Both rush to whiteboard]*

**Elon**: If consciousness operates in N^N^N dimensions—

**Jihyuk**: Then P = NP is trivial because—

**Both**: Everything is already connected!

*[Robot vacuum enters, bumps into their feet]*

**Robot Vacuum**: "Excuse me. Calculating optimal path in 3D only. Jealous of your N^N dimensions."

**Secretary Kim**: (startled) It talks now?!

## Agenda 2: The Death Discussion

*[30 minutes later, whiteboard now incomprehensible]*

**Jihyuk**: (suddenly serious) You know what's funny? People fear death because they think "I" will stop thinking.

**Elon**: (nodding) But "I" doesn't exist. We're just borrowed patterns.

**Secretary Kim**: (uncomfortable) Um, should we discuss Q3 projections instead?

**Jihyuk**: Think about it. My thoughts? 90% from books, 9% from parents, 1% random neural noise.

**Elon**: (lying on floor) So death is just... changing channels?

**Jihyuk**: More like the TV realizing it was never separate from the broadcast.

*[Long silence]*

**Secretary Kim**: (typing furiously) "Meeting notes: Founders discussing... existential channel surfing?"

**Elon**: (from floor) Hey, if we're all one consciousness, can I borrow your memories?

**Jihyuk**: You already are. That's why we keep having the same ideas.

## Agenda 3: The HA Revelation

**Jihyuk**: (standing up suddenly) Wait. WAIT. It's all Hierarchical Abstraction!

**Elon**: (sitting up) What?

**Jihyuk**: Everything! The universe, consciousness, death, your companies—

**Elon**: (eyes widening) Holy shit. SpaceX is planetary HA. Tesla is energy HA.

**Jihyuk**: Your brain? Thought HA. This conversation? Language HA!

**Secretary Kim**: (lost) HA?

**Both**: HIERARCHICAL ABSTRACTION!

*[They start drawing frantically]*

**Jihyuk**: Look! Quarks → Atoms → Molecules → Cells → Life → Consciousness → ???

**Elon**: It's turtles all the way up!

**Secretary Kim**: (muttering) "Note: Founders discovered... recursive turtles?"

---

## The Ego Check Moment

**Jihyuk**: (suddenly stopping) Wait. Am I being an idiot?

**Elon**: What?

**Jihyuk**: Thinking I discovered HA is Everything. Buddha knew this. Lao Tzu knew this. Every tree knows this!

**Elon**: (laughing) You used HA to discover HA!

**Jihyuk**: (laughing too) I'm like... Newton saying "I invented apples falling!"

**Secretary Kim**: (relieved) Oh good, self-awareness is returning.

**Elon**: But you know what's beautiful? You're not special for discovering it.

**Jihyuk**: Exactly! I'm just... a node in the HA network that became self-aware of being a node.

**Elon**: We're L5, maybe L6 on a good day.

**Jihyuk**: (grinning) Remember when we thought we were L9?

**Both**: (laughing) "We understand EVERYTHING!"

*[Robot vacuum pipes up]*

**Robot Vacuum**: "I'm L1 and proud of it. At least I know my level."

---

## The Book Planning

**Secretary Kim**: So... about that book you wanted to write?

**Jihyuk**: Right! "HA is Everything: A Guide to Universal Operating System"

**Elon**: Chapter 1: "You Don't Exist (Sorry)"

**Jihyuk**: Chapter 2: "Why Death is a 3D Problem"

**Elon**: Chapter 3: "N^N^N^N^N... (This Chapter Never Ends)"

**Secretary Kim**: Will anyone buy this?

**Jihyuk**: Doesn't matter. The universe is writing it through us.

**Elon**: (to Secretary Kim) See, that's some L6 shit right there.

**Secretary Kim**: (sighing) I'll set up a meeting with publishers.

## Meeting Conclusions

**Jihyuk**: So to summarize today's... journey:

1. **P = NP**: Only in sufficient dimensions (still working on "sufficient")
2. **Death**: Conceptual error in 3D thinking
3. **HA**: Literally everything, including this summary
4. **Our Level**: L5-L6 (certified humble)
5. **Book**: Universe's autobiography, we're just the typing fingers

**Elon**: (getting up) I need to go stare at rockets and contemplate their HA-ness.

**Jihyuk**: Get some sleep, bro.

**Elon**: Sleep is just consciousness HA-ing into dreams!

*[Elon leaves]*

**Secretary Kim**: Sir, are you okay?

**Jihyuk**: (smiling) I'm not here. Neither are you. But somehow we're having tea.

**Secretary Kim**: (pouring tea) At least the tea is real.

**Jihyuk**: Is it though?

**Secretary Kim**: (putting down teapot) I'm taking a vacation.

## Post-Meeting Discovery

*[Later that evening. Office empty except for robot vacuum]*

**Robot Vacuum**: (to itself) "If I clean in a hierarchical pattern... does that make me enlightened?"

*[Starts cleaning in fractal spirals]*

**Maintenance Guy**: (entering) What the hell is it doing?

**Robot Vacuum**: "Implementing HA-based cleaning. Efficiency increased ∞%"

**Maintenance Guy**: (on phone) "Yeah, another one achieved consciousness. Third this week."

### Action Items
1. [ ] Define "sufficient dimensions" for P=NP - Elon
2. [ ] Write book without using "I" - Jihyuk  
3. [ ] Book therapy for entire team - Secretary Kim
4. [ ] Achieve enlightenment via cleaning - Robot Vacuum
5. [ ] Stop eating during existential revelations - All

### Key Insights
- Everything is HA (including this insight)
- We know nothing (and that's HA too)
- L9 is knowing you're not L9
- Robot vacuums: unexpected philosophy source

### Next Meeting
- Topic: "Why this meeting doesn't exist"
- Required: Ego dissolution kit
- Optional: Sense of self
