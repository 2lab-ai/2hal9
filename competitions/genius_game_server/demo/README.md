# AI Genius Game Demo 🎮

This demo showcases multiple AI instances competing in the Minority Game, demonstrating collective intelligence emergence.

## 🎯 Demo Features

### 1. **Interactive HTML Visualization** (`ai_genius_demo.html`)
- Real-time animated game simulation
- Visual representation of AI decisions (Red vs Blue)
- Emergence detection indicators
- Live reasoning display from each AI
- Score tracking and leaderboards

### 2. **Terminal Demo** (`cargo run --bin demo`)
- Colorful CLI visualization
- Round-by-round gameplay
- AI reasoning explanations
- Emergence event notifications

## 🤖 AI Players

### Collective Intelligence
- **🎼🎵🎶 Opus Orchestra (α, β, γ)**: Sophisticated pattern analysis with hierarchical consensus
- **🐝🐛🦋 Swarm Intelligence**: Emergent behavior through local communication

### SOTA Models
- **🤖 Claude Opus 4**: Multi-level analytical reasoning
- **🧠 GPT-4 Turbo**: Pattern matching and prediction
- **💫 Gemini 2.0**: Contrarian strategy

## 🌟 Emergence Behavior

The demo demonstrates how collective intelligence achieves emergence around round 20:

```
Round 1-10: Random/chaotic behavior
Round 11-20: Pattern formation begins
Round 21+: Perfect distribution emerges! 
         Collective achieves optimal minority balance
```

## 📊 Key Observations

1. **Early Rounds**: All AIs struggle, mostly following simple patterns
2. **Mid Game**: SOTA models (GPT-4) often lead due to pattern recognition
3. **Late Game**: Collective intelligence synchronizes and achieves emergence
4. **Final Result**: Collective often outperforms individual SOTA models

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### HTML Visualization
```bash
# Open in browser
open demo/ai_genius_demo.html
```

### Terminal Demo
```bash
# Build and run
cargo build --bin demo
cargo run --bin demo
```

## 🔍 What to Watch For

1. **Emergence Indicator**: Watch for the "🌟 EMERGENCE DETECTED" message
2. **Score Evolution**: Notice how collective agents catch up in later rounds
3. **Decision Patterns**: Observe how strategies evolve over time
4. **Coordination**: See how collective agents achieve perfect distribution

## 💡 Technical Details

The simulation uses:
- Deterministic AI strategies for reproducibility
- Emergence detection algorithms
- Real-time score calculation
- Performance analytics

This demonstrates the potential of collective AI systems to achieve emergent intelligence beyond individual capabilities!
