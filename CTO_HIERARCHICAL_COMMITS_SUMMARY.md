## Abstraction Levels in Commits

### L1 - Operational (Lowest)
- **Audience**: Operators, Users
- **Content**: Commands, procedures, troubleshooting
- **Philosophy**: "Keep it simple. Keep it running."

### L2 - Implementation  
- **Audience**: Developers, Engineers
- **Content**: Code examples, step-by-step guides
- **Philosophy**: "Code is poetry, but it should work."

### L3 - Design
- **Audience**: Tech Leads, Senior Developers
- **Content**: Specifications, APIs, patterns
- **Philosophy**: "Design is how it works."

### L4 - Architecture
- **Audience**: System Architects
- **Content**: Patterns, decisions, system design
- **Philosophy**: "Architecture is about the important stuff."

### L5 - Strategic (Highest)
- **Audience**: Executives, Visionaries
- **Content**: Vision, philosophy, long-term strategy

### Meta - Hierarchy
- **Audience**: All stakeholders
- **Content**: Documentation structure
- **Philosophy**: "Right abstraction for the right audience."

## Impact

Each commit message includes:
1. **Abstraction level** clearly stated
2. **Target audience** identified
3. **Content summary** provided
4. **Philosophical quote** aligned with level

This demonstrates how hierarchical thinking applies not just to code and documentation, but even to our commit history.

## Conclusion

The commit structure itself embodies HAL9's core principle:
> "Hierarchical Abstraction is All You Need"

Even our git history now reflects proper abstraction levels!
