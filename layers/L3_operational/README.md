# L3 - Operational Layer

**Cognitive Level**: L3_operational  
**Temporal Scope**: Hours to days  
**Purpose**: Component design, deployment, and operational management

## Overview

This level contains detailed component specifications, deployment configurations, and operational workflows. Engineers and operators work here to translate architectural decisions into running systems.

## Structure

- `architecture/` - Component implementations and detailed designs
  - `server/` - Core server components
  - `browser/` - Browser automation subsystem  
  - `cli/` - Command-line interface
  - `kubernetes/` - K8s deployment specifications
  - `gateway/` - API gateway configuration
  
- `configuration/` - System and deployment configurations
  - `docker/` - Container definitions
  - `deployment/` - Deployment orchestration
  - `system/` - Production configurations

- `workflows/` - Operational procedures and monitoring
  - `monitoring/` - Grafana, Prometheus configurations
  
- `validation/` - Component testing and demos
  - `demos/` - MVP demonstrations
  
- `optimization/` - Performance tuning configurations

## For Engineers and Operators

This is where architecture becomes reality. You'll find:

### Component Specifications
- Detailed API designs
- Database schemas  
- Service interfaces
- Integration patterns

### Deployment Guides
- Docker configurations
- Kubernetes manifests
- Helm charts
- Production deployments

### Operational Workflows
- Monitoring setup
- Alert configurations
- Runbook procedures
- Performance optimization

## Navigation

- **Down** → [L2 Implementation](../L2_implementation/) for source code
- **Up** → [L4 Tactical](../L4_tactical/) for architectural decisions
- **Lateral** → All operational concerns at the same level

## What Belongs Here

✅ DO include:
- Component specifications
- API documentation
- Deployment configurations
- Integration guides
- Monitoring setups
- Operational procedures
- Performance benchmarks

❌ DON'T include:
- Source code (→ L2)
- High-level architecture (→ L4)
- Business requirements (→ L7)
- Strategic plans (→ L5)
- Daily scripts (→ L1)

## Key Components at This Level

### Server Architecture
- GraphQL API server
- Authentication services
- Cost tracking subsystem
- Memory management
- Network protocols
- Plugin system
- Scaling infrastructure

### Browser Automation
- Context pool management
- Security boundaries
- Metrics collection
- Tool integrations

### Deployment Infrastructure
- Kubernetes operators
- Helm charts
- Service meshes
- Load balancers
- Database clusters

## Operational Principles

1. **Design for Failure** - Every component must handle failures gracefully
2. **Observable by Default** - Metrics and logs for everything
3. **Scalable from Start** - No architectural bottlenecks
4. **Secure at Runtime** - Defense in depth
5. **Automatable Operations** - Reduce manual intervention

## Time Horizons

L3 operates on:
- **Hours** - Component responses and updates
- **Days** - Deployment cycles and migrations
- **Weeks** - Operational improvements

## Key Metrics

- Component availability (99.9% target)
- API response times (<100ms p95)
- Deployment frequency (daily capability)
- Error rates (<0.1%)
- Resource utilization (70-80% optimal)

## Integration Points

### From L4 (Receives)
- Architectural patterns to implement
- System design specifications
- Performance requirements
- Scaling strategies

### To L2 (Provides)
- Component interfaces to implement
- API contracts to fulfill
- Performance targets to meet
- Integration specifications

### From L2 (Receives)
- Implementation status
- Performance metrics
- Error reports
- Resource usage

### To L4 (Provides)
- Operational feasibility feedback
- Performance characteristics
- Scaling limitations
- Cost implications

## Common Tasks

1. **Design New Component**
   - Review L4 architecture
   - Define interfaces
   - Specify APIs
   - Document integration

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - Update configurations
   - Prepare rollback plan
   - Execute deployment
   - Monitor metrics

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Design solutions
   - Test improvements
   - Deploy changes

## The Operational Lens

Everything at this level focuses on:
- **Reliability** over elegance
- **Performance** over perfection
- **Observability** over assumptions
- **Automation** over documentation
- **Security** over convenience
