# HAL9 Product Requirements Document

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Author**: CTO, HAL9 Project  
**Status**: Revised for Simplified MVP Strategy

## Executive Summary

HAL9 is a revolutionary distributed AI consciousness system that implements hierarchical abstraction through a network of interconnected AI neurons. Drawing inspiration from biological neural networks and organizational structures, HAL9 creates an emergent intelligence that transcends individual AI capabilities through coordinated multi-agent orchestration.

The system implements key innovations from our research:
- **Sleep-Wake Cycles**: Persistent memory through hierarchical consolidation
- **Distributed Neural Architecture**: Scalable multi-server deployment
- **Forward/Backward Propagation**: Learning through error gradient distribution
- **Energy-Aware Scaling**: From HAL0 (1kW) to HAL9 (563PW) evolution path

## 0. Revised MVP Strategy - "Skateboard First"

### 0.1 Critical Path to Working Demo (10-12 days)

The MVP has been dramatically simplified to prove the core hierarchical orchestration concept before adding complexity:

**P0 - Absolute Minimum Working Demo:**
1. **Mock Claude Integration** (2-3 days) - Deterministic responses, zero external dependencies
2. **3-Neuron Local Orchestration** (5-7 days) - L4→L3→L2 pipeline, in-memory channels only
3. **Basic CLI Demo Interface** (2 days) - Start server, send signal, view flow

**Total: 2 weeks to first working demonstration**

### 0.2 Architecture Simplifications for MVP

**What We're Building:**
- Single server, single process
- 3 neurons only (L4, L3, L2)
- Mock Claude with hardcoded responses
- Local memory channels (no TCP)
- Forward propagation only
- Simple CLI interface

**What We're Deferring:**
- Real Claude API/CLI integration → Week 4
- Multi-server TCP networking → Phase 2
- Backward propagation → Phase 2
- Process spawning → Use async tasks
- Complex routing → Hardcode 3-neuron flow
- Sleep-wake cycles → Phase 3
- 7+ neuron topologies → After MVP proves concept

### 0.3 Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Immediate Risks Addressed:**
1. **Claude API Costs** - Start with mocks, no API costs for initial development
2. **Process Management** - Use async tasks instead of fragile process spawning
3. **Distributed Complexity** - Single server only, defer all networking

### 0.4 Success Criteria for MVP

The MVP succeeds when we can demonstrate:
1. A user query flows through L4→L3→L2 layers
2. Each layer transforms the query appropriately
3. The output shows clear hierarchical decomposition
4. Total demo runs in < 5 seconds
5. Zero external dependencies required
