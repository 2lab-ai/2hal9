# L2_implementation Broken Links Report

## Summary
Found 4 markdown files in L2_implementation directory. Analyzed all relative links and found several broken references.

## Files Analyzed
1. `/L2_implementation/README.md`
2. `/L2_implementation/execution/development-guide.md`
3. `/L2_implementation/validation/testing-methodology.md`
4. `/L2_implementation/validation/benchmarks/README.md`

## Broken Links Found

### 1. In `/L2_implementation/execution/development-guide.md`

#### Line 451-454: Invalid relative paths
```markdown
- [Architecture Guide](../overview/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [API Reference](../technical/api/)
- [Performance Guide](../deployment/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
```
**Issue**: These paths assume a different directory structure. The files don't exist at `../overview/`, `../technical/`, or `../deployment/` relative to the development-guide.md location.

**Suggested Fix**: These files appear to be in the legacy-docs folder. Update to:
```markdown
- [Architecture Guide](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L6_executive/overview/architecture-summary.md)
- [API Reference](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L9_universal/wisdom/legacy-docs/technical/README.md)
- [Performance Guide](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L4_tactical/strategies/architecture/L4_PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
```

### 2. In `/L2_implementation/validation/testing-methodology.md`

#### Line 521-523: Invalid relative paths
```markdown
- [MVP Testing Guide](../mvp/TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [Performance Testing](../deployment/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
- [CI/CD Setup](../deployment/CI_CD_GUIDE.md)
```
**Issue**: These paths don't exist relative to the testing-methodology.md location.

**Suggested Fix**: Update to correct paths:
```markdown
- [MVP Testing Guide](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L9_universal/wisdom/legacy-docs/L2_implementation/L2_MVP_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- [Performance Testing](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L4_tactical/strategies/architecture/L4_PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md)
- CI/CD Setup - File not found in repository
```

### 3. In `/L2_implementation/validation/benchmarks/README.md`

#### Line 271-273: Invalid relative paths
```markdown
- [Performance Optimization Guide](../docs/L4_architecture/L4_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [System Architecture](../docs/L4_architecture/L4_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Monitoring Guide](../docs/L1_operational/L1_MONITORING_GUIDE.md)
```
**Issue**: The `../docs/` directory doesn't exist relative to the benchmarks folder.

**Suggested Fix**: Update to correct paths:
```markdown
- [Performance Optimization Guide](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L4_tactical/strategies/architecture/L4_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [System Architecture](/Users/icedac/2lab.ai/2hal9/L4_tactical/strategies/architecture/L4_L4_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Monitoring Guide - File not found (possibly in L1_reflexive/status/monitoring.md)
```

## Navigation Links Status

### In `/L2_implementation/README.md` (Lines 45-48)
```markdown
- **Down** → [Substrate](../substrate/) for infrastructure details ✓
- **Up** → [L3 Operational](../L3_operational/) for architecture decisions ✓
- **Lateral** → All implementation concerns at the same level ✓
```
**Status**: All navigation links are correct and working.

## Recommendations

1. **Update all broken relative links** to use correct paths based on the current directory structure
2. **Consider using absolute paths** from the project root for better maintainability
3. **Add a link validation script** to CI/CD pipeline to catch broken links early
4. **Some referenced files may not exist** - verify if they should be created or if the references should be removed

## Files Not Found
The following files were referenced but not found in the repository:
- `CI_CD_GUIDE.md`
- `L1_MONITORING_GUIDE.md` (though `monitoring.md` exists in L1_reflexive/status/)
