# L4: Tactical Layer - Integration & Coordination

## Overview

The L4 Tactical Layer serves as the integration and coordination hub of the HAL9 system, bridging operational execution with strategic planning. This layer handles:

- **System Integration**: Coordinating between different components and services
- **Migration Planning**: Managing system transitions and upgrades
- **Performance Analysis**: Tactical optimization and bottleneck resolution
- **Architecture Patterns**: Design decisions and system patterns

- **Design Patterns**: [strategies/architecture/L4_SYSTEM_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md](strategies/architecture/L4_SYSTEM_DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)
- **Navigation**: [strategies/architecture/L4_NAVIGATION_README.md](strategies/architecture/L4_NAVIGATION_README.md)

### For Operations
- **Migration Runbooks**: [planning/runbooks/](planning/runbooks/)
- **Migration Tool**: [planning/migration/tools/hal9-migrate/](planning/migration/tools/hal9-migrate/)
- **Performance Analysis**: [analysis/performance/](analysis/performance/)

### For Planning
- **Backup Procedures**: [planning/backup/](planning/backup/)
- **Emergency Rollback**: [planning/runbooks/emergency/rollback-procedures.md](planning/runbooks/emergency/rollback-procedures.md)

## Key Components

### 1. Architecture Strategies

Located in `strategies/architecture/`, containing:
- Hierarchical abstraction patterns
- Distributed scaling architecture
- Performance optimization strategies
- Browser automation architecture
- Enterprise authentication patterns

### 2. Migration Framework

The migration framework in `planning/migration/` provides:
- Pre-migration checklists
- Shadow mode deployment
- Canary deployment strategies
- State migration procedures
- Traffic ramp-up protocols
- Full cutover procedures
- Post-migration validation

### 3. Performance Analysis

Tools and scripts for:
- Performance trend analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource optimization
- Scaling recommendations

## Integration Points

The L4 Tactical layer interfaces with:

- **L3 Operational**: Receives operational metrics and issues
- **L5 Strategic**: Implements strategic directives
- **L2 Implementation**: Provides architectural patterns
- **L1 Reflexive**: Coordinates immediate responses

## Common Operations

### Performance Analysis
```bash
./L4_tactical/analysis/performance/trends.sh
```

### Migration Planning
```bash
# Check migration readiness
./L4_tactical/planning/migration/tools/hal9-migrate/hal9-migrate pre-check

# View migration status
./L4_tactical/planning/migration/tools/hal9-migrate/hal9-migrate status
```

### Backup Operations
```bash
./L4_tactical/planning/backup/backup.sh
```

## Architecture Decisions

Key architectural decisions are documented in:
- [L4_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md](strategies/architecture/L4_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)
- [L4_HIERARCHICAL_ABSTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md](strategies/architecture/L4_HIERARCHICAL_ABSTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md)

These documents outline:
- Component integration patterns
- Scaling strategies
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization approaches

## Development Guidelines

When working with the L4 Tactical layer:

1. **Document Architecture Decisions**: Use ADR format in `strategies/architecture/`
2. **Create Runbooks**: Add operational procedures to `planning/runbooks/`
3. **Performance First**: Always consider performance implications
4. **Migration Safety**: Test all migration procedures thoroughly
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure cross-layer compatibility

## Maintenance

Regular tactical maintenance includes:
- Review and update architecture documentation quarterly
- Test migration procedures before major updates
- Analyze performance trends monthly
- Update integration patterns as needed
- Archive legacy scripts after successful migrations
