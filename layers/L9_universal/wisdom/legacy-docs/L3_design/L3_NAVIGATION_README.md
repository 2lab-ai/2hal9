# L3: Component Design Documentation

**Abstraction Level**: L3 - Detailed Design & Specifications  
**Audience**: Senior Engineers, Component Owners, API Designers, Integration Engineers

## Welcome to Design Level

This level contains detailed component designs, API specifications, and integration patterns. We specify HOW components work and interact.

## Who Should Read This Level

- **Senior Engineers** designing components
- **API Designers** creating interfaces
- **Integration Engineers** connecting systems
- **Tech Leads** reviewing designs
- **QA Engineers** understanding specifications

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Documents

All documents prefixed with L3_ including:
- Component specifications
- API documentation
- Integration patterns
- Design patterns
- Protocol specifications

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **Component Design** - Detailed component behavior
- **API Contracts** - Interface specifications
- **Integration Patterns** - How to connect systems
- **Data Models** - Information structures
- **Protocols** - Communication standards

## Design Principles

1. **Interface First** - Design APIs before implementation
2. **Loose Coupling** - Minimize dependencies
3. **High Cohesion** - Related functionality together
4. **Extensibility** - Design for future needs
5. **Testability** - Design for verification

## What NOT to Expect

- High-level strategy
- Implementation code
- Deployment scripts
- Philosophical discussions
- Business metrics

## Navigation

- **Architecture Context**: [L4 Architecture](../L4_architecture/)
- **Implementation Guide**: [L2 Implementation](../L2_implementation/)
- **API Usage**: See specific API docs

## Design Artifacts

At L3, we create:
- **Interface Definitions** - API contracts
- **Sequence Diagrams** - Interaction flows
- **State Machines** - Component behavior
- **Data Models** - Information structure
- **Integration Guides** - How to connect

## Quality Standards

L3 designs must include:
- **Functional Requirements** - What it does
- **Non-functional Requirements** - How well it does it
- **Error Handling** - Failure scenarios
- **Performance Targets** - Speed and scale
- **Security Considerations** - Protection mechanisms

## Contributing to L3

When contributing:
1. Be specific and detailed
2. Include examples
3. Define error cases
4. Specify performance
5. Document assumptions
