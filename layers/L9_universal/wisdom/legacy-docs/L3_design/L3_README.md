**Level**: L3 - System Design  
**Abstraction**: Component design and integration patterns

## Who Should Read This

This folder contains documentation for:
- **Tech Leads** designing components
- **Senior Developers** implementing features
- **Integration Engineers** connecting systems
- **API Designers** creating interfaces

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Documents

1. **[COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md](./COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md)**
   - Detailed component interfaces
   - Responsibilities and interactions
   - Performance specifications

2. **[INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md](./INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md)**
   - How to integrate with HAL9
   - External and internal patterns
   - Protocol implementations

3. **API Design Documents**
   - [GRAPHQL_API_V2.md](./GRAPHQL_API_V2.md) - GraphQL API design
   - [MCP_INTEGRATION.md](./MCP_INTEGRATION.md) - Model Context Protocol
   - [BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md](./BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md) - Blockchain integration

4. **Component Design Documents**
   - [MEMORY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./MEMORY_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
   - [BACKWARD_PROPAGATION_DESIGN.md](./BACKWARD_PROPAGATION_DESIGN.md)
   - [WASM_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md](./WASM_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md)
   - [HAL9_OPERATOR_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md](./HAL9_OPERATOR_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md)

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **Interfaces** - How components communicate
- **Protocols** - Message formats and flows
- **Integration** - Connecting with external systems
- **Patterns** - Reusable design solutions
- **Specifications** - Detailed component behavior

## What NOT to Expect

This level does NOT contain:
- High-level philosophy
- Implementation code
- Operational procedures
- Architectural decisions (see L4)
- Daily tasks (see L1)

## Navigation

- **Architecture Context**: See [L4 Architectural](../L4_architectural/) for system design
- **Implementation**: See [L2 Implementation](../L2_implementation/) for code examples
- **Operations**: See [L1 Operational](../L1_operational/) for running systems

## Reading Order

1. **For Component Designers**:
   - Start with [Component Specifications](./COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md)
   - Review relevant component designs
   - Check [Integration Patterns](./INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md)

2. **For API Developers**:
   - Jump to API design documents
   - Understand protocols and patterns
   - Review integration examples

## Key Questions Answered

- How do components interact?
- What are the API contracts?
- How to integrate external systems?
- What protocols should I use?
- How to extend functionality?

## Design Principles

1. **Clear Interfaces** - Well-defined component boundaries
2. **Protocol-First** - Communication before implementation
3. **Extensibility** - Design for future needs
4. **Performance** - Meet specified targets
5. **Testability** - Design for verification
