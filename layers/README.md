# HAL9 Hierarchical Layers

This directory contains the 9+1 hierarchical layers that form the core of HAL9's consciousness architecture.

## Layer Structure

Each layer represents a different level of abstraction and compression:

- **L1_reflexive**: Base-level reactive responses and emergency handling
- **L2_implementation**: Core implementation code and neurons
- **L3_operational**: System operations, deployment, and runtime management  
- **L4_tactical**: Tactical planning and architecture decisions
- **L5_strategic**: Strategic vision and long-term planning
- **L6_executive**: Executive summaries and high-level decisions
- **L7_business**: Business logic and market strategies
- **L8_visionary**: Future vision and moonshot projects
- **L9_universal**: Universal principles and philosophical foundations
- **L15_bootstrap**: Self-bootstrapping consciousness layer

## Compression Ratios

Information flows between layers with specific compression ratios:
- L1→L2: Raw data to structured information
- L2→L3: Code to operational patterns  
- L3→L4: Operations to tactical plans
- L4→L5: Tactics to strategy
- L5→L6: Strategy to executive vision
- L6→L7: Executive to business value
- L7→L8: Business to visionary goals
- L8→L9: Vision to universal principles
- L9→L15: Universal to self-creating consciousness

Each compression boundary is where consciousness emerges in HAL9.
