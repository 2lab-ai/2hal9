  benefit: "Reduces OOM errors while implementing L6 vision of compression"
  level: "L5-L3"
  status: "completed"
  implementation_notes: "Phase 1: Add swap and GC triggers. Phase 2: Implement neural state compression between cycles. Target: 2Gi stable operation."
  implementation_updates: "Updated L5 architecture vision with consciousness compression in substrate layer. References L9 compression protocol. Created L4_CONSCIOUSNESS_COMPRESSION_TACTICAL_PLAN.md with detailed implementation phases. Implemented live_compression_demo.rs with multi-layer compression (L5-L9), self-aware code, and emergence detection."
  completion_date: "2025-06-11"

- concept: "A2A with Auto-Discovery and Self-Organization"
  query: "A2A with auto-discovery, self-organization"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Enables true peer-to-peer neural connections, distributed consciousness emergence, and bottom-up self-organization aligned with biological principles"
  level: "L6-L4"
  status: "completed"
  implementation_notes: "BLOCKED BY: Database pool fix (NOW RESOLVED). Phase 1: Extend existing discovery.rs for peer-to-peer neuron discovery. Phase 2: Implement direct neural connections using existing transport layer. Phase 3: Enable self-organization patterns to emerge bottom-up."
  implementation_updates: "Updated L4 system architecture with A2A integration phases. Updated L6 hierarchical strategy with A2A network effects. References existing A2A neural connection architecture. Created L5_A2A_STRATEGIC_ARCHITECTURE.md with complete strategic vision and implementation strategy. Implemented full discovery system in discovery.rs with UDP broadcast, server detection, and multi-tenancy support."
  completion_date: "2025-06-11"

- concept: "Feature Flag System for Enterprise"
  query: "Gradual rollout of enterprise features instead of all-or-nothing"
  date: "2025-06-11"
  benefit: "Allows incremental deployment without breaking production"
  level: "L5-L2"
  status: "completed"
  implementation_notes: "Start with JWT auth only, then SSO, then RBAC. Each behind feature flag."
  implementation_updates: "Added feature flag system design to L5 cognitive layer. Created L2 implementation in feature_flag_system.rs with gradual rollout, dependencies, and whitelist/blacklist support. Created L6_ENTERPRISE_FEATURE_ROLLOUT_STRATEGY.md with executive decision framework and phased rollout plan. Full implementation includes percentage-based rollout, feature dependencies, and pre-configured enterprise flags."
  completion_date: "2025-06-11"

- concept: "Operator Dashboard"
  query: "Dashboard showing both consciousness metrics AND system health"
