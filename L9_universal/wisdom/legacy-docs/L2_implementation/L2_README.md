   - Concrete implementation steps
   - Code examples and patterns
   - Migration procedures

2. **[CODE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./CODE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)**
   - How to migrate existing code
   - Compatibility patterns
   - Step-by-step instructions

3. **[TESTING_CHECKLIST.md](./TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)**
   - Comprehensive testing procedures
   - Test examples and templates
   - Coverage requirements

4. **[BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md](./BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md)**
   - Build instructions
   - Deployment procedures
   - CI/CD configuration

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **Code** - Actual implementation examples
- **Steps** - Sequential instructions
- **Commands** - Exact commands to run
- **Configuration** - Specific settings
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes

## What NOT to Expect

This level does NOT contain:
- Architectural philosophy
- System design rationale
- Strategic vision
- Abstract concepts
- Operational procedures (see L1)

## Navigation

- **Design Context**: See [L3 Design](../L3_design/) for specifications
- **Operations**: See [L1 Operational](../L1_operational/) for running systems
- **Architecture**: See [L4 Architectural](../L4_architectural/) for big picture

## Reading Order

1. **For New Developers**:
   - Start with [Refactoring Step-by-Step](./REFACTORING_STEP_BY_STEP.md)
   - Review [Code Migration Guide](./CODE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
   - Follow [Testing Checklist](./TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)

2. **For DevOps**:
   - Jump to [Build and Deploy](./BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md)
   - Check testing requirements
   - Review migration procedures

## Key Questions Answered

- How do I implement this feature?
- What's the exact code I need?
- How do I test my changes?
- How do I deploy this?
- What commands do I run?

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Follow Examples** - Copy and adapt provided code
2. **Test Everything** - Use the checklist
3. **Document Changes** - Update relevant docs
4. **Ask Questions** - When stuck, check L3 design
5. **Share Knowledge** - Add new patterns you discover
