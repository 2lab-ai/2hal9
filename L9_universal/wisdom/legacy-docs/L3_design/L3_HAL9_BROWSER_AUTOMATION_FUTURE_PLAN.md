        // Start monitoring for deposits
        self.blockchain_monitor
            .watch_address(address.clone(), user_id).await?;
        
        Ok(address)
    }
    
    pub async fn process_deposit(
        &self,
        transaction: TONTransaction,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Verify transaction
        let verified = self.ton_client
            .verify_transaction(&transaction).await?;
        
        if verified {
            // Credit user balance
            self.credit_user_balance(
                transaction.user_id,
                transaction.amount
            ).await?;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### 3. Order Management System
```rust
pub struct OrderManager {
    db: Database,
    tracking_service: TrackingService,
    notification_service: NotificationService,
}

impl OrderManager {
    pub async fn create_order(
        &self,
        user_id: UserId,
        platform: Platform,
        details: OrderDetails,
    ) -> Result<Order> {
        let order = Order {
            id: Uuid::new_v4(),
            user_id,
            platform,
            status: OrderStatus::Pending,
            details,
            created_at: Utc::now(),
        };
        
        // Store order
        self.db.insert_order(&order).await?;
        
        // Start tracking
        self.tracking_service
            .start_tracking(&order).await?;
        
        Ok(order)
    }
}
```

### Security Architecture

#### 1. Credential Management
```rust
pub struct SecureCredentialVault {
    encryption_key: Key,
    storage: EncryptedStorage,
}

impl SecureCredentialVault {
    pub async fn store_credentials(
        &self,
        user_id: UserId,
        platform: Platform,
        credentials: Credentials,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        // Encrypt credentials
        let encrypted = self.encrypt(credentials)?;
        
        // Store with user isolation
        self.storage.store(
            format!("{}/{}", user_id, platform),
            encrypted
        ).await?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### 2. Transaction Security
