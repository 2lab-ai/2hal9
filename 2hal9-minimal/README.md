# HAL9 Minimal - Actually Working Code Only

## What This Is

This is the **minimal, working version** of HAL9 with all theoretical/philosophical content removed.

### What's Included

- **hal9-core**: Neuron system and hierarchical intelligence (working parts)
- **hal9-server**: HTTP/WebSocket API server 
- **hal9-cli**: Command-line interface
- **game_neurons**: Working game implementation

### What's Removed

- 9-layer consciousness theories (L3-L9 were 99% documentation)
- Quantum entanglement philosophy
- Inter-universe protocols
- 40,000+ lines of theoretical documentation
- Non-working experiments

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build --release

# Run the server
cargo run --bin hal9-server

# Server starts at http://localhost:8080
```

## Test It

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run a specific game
cargo run --bin ultima-pal-desktop --features desktop
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/status` - Server status
- `POST /api/v1/signal` - Send neuron signal
- `WS /ws` - WebSocket connection

## Project Stats

- **Before**: ~180,000 lines (mostly theory)
- **After**: ~15,000 lines (actual code)
- **Tests**: 200+ passing
- **Dependencies**: Reduced by 60%

## What Actually Works

1. Self-organizing neuron networks
2. HTTP/WebSocket server
3. Basic game AI
4. CLI tools
5. Authentication system
6. Metrics/monitoring

## Philosophy

> "Less theory, more working code."

This minimal version focuses on what's implemented and tested, not what could theoretically exist in a 9-dimensional consciousness matrix.
