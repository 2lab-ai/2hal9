## 📝 Issue Creation Guidelines

### Good Issue Example
```markdown
Title: GraphQL queries timeout on large datasets

Description:
When querying for more than 1000 neurons with nested signals, the GraphQL API times out after 30 seconds.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send query: `{ neurons(limit: 1000) { id signals { content } } }`
2. Wait for response
3. Observe timeout error

Expected: Query completes within 5 seconds
Actual: Query times out after 30 seconds

Environment:
- Version: 0.9.5
- Database: PostgreSQL 14
- Dataset: 5000 neurons, 50k signals

Proposed Solution:
Implement cursor-based pagination and query optimization
```
