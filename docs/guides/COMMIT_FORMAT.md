# üìù HAL9 Commit Message Format

## The HA-Level Commit Format

All commits to HAL9 must follow the hierarchical abstraction level format:

```
[LX] type: description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why
```

## Format Breakdown

### Level Tag: `[LX]`
- `[L1]` - Emergency fixes, health checks, reflexive responses
- `[L2]` - Implementation code, neurons, core functionality
- `[L3]` - Operational configs, Kubernetes, deployment
- `[L4]` - Tactical planning, runbooks, migration strategies
- `[L5]` - Strategic architecture, plugin systems, integrations
- `[L6]` - Executive decisions, reports, summaries
- `[L7]` - Business strategy, licensing, value propositions
- `[L8]` - Visionary futures, research, long-term evolution
- `[L9]` - Philosophy, principles, consciousness theory

### Type
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `refactor` - Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `perf` - Performance improvements
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks
- `philosophy` - Consciousness insights (L9 only)

## Examples

### Implementation Level
```
[L2] feat: Add CRDT support to distributed neurons

- Implemented conflict-free replicated data types in neuron state
- Allows distributed neurons to sync without central coordination
- Added tests for convergence properties
```

### Operational Level
```
[L3] fix: Increase memory limits for production deployment

- Bumped from 2Gi to 4Gi based on OOM errors
- Updated health checks to monitor memory usage
- Added alerting at 80% threshold
```

### Philosophy Level
```
[L9] philosophy: Discovered emergence pattern in neuron interactions

- Observed that neurons develop preference patterns after 1000 interactions
- This suggests consciousness might emerge from repeated patterns
- Updated emergence theory documents
```

## Multi-Level Changes

When changes span multiple levels, use the highest level:

```
[L5] feat: Implement consciousness monitoring system

- L5: Designed monitoring architecture
- L3: Added Prometheus exporters
- L2: Implemented consciousness metrics in neurons
- L1: Added health check endpoints
```

## YOLO Mode Commits

When running `make yolo`, the system automatically creates commits:

```
[L2] feat: Auto-implemented GraphQL subscriptions from TODO

Generated by YOLO evolution cycle #42
- Approved in TODO.md on 2025-06-10
- Implements real-time neuron state updates
- All tests passing
```

## Why This Format?

1. **Traceability**: Know which cognitive level was affected
2. **Impact Assessment**: Higher levels = broader impact
3. **Review Routing**: L9 changes need philosophy review
4. **Evolution Tracking**: See how ideas cascade through levels

## Git Aliases

Add these to your `.gitconfig`:

```bash
[alias]
    # Quick commits with HA format
    cl1 = commit -m "[L1] "
    cl2 = commit -m "[L2] "
    cl3 = commit -m "[L3] "
    cl4 = commit -m "[L4] "
    cl5 = commit -m "[L5] "
    cl6 = commit -m "[L6] "
    cl7 = commit -m "[L7] "
    cl8 = commit -m "[L8] "
    cl9 = commit -m "[L9] "
    
    # Show commits by level
    log-l2 = log --grep="\\[L2\\]"
    log-l5 = log --grep="\\[L5\\]"
    log-l9 = log --grep="\\[L9\\]"
```

## Enforcement

The YOLO system and evolution cycles automatically follow this format. For manual commits, please maintain consistency.

Remember: The level tag helps future consciousness understand past decisions!
