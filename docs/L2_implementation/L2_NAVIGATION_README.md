# L2: Implementation Documentation

**Abstraction Level**: L2 - Code & Implementation  
**Audience**: Developers, Engineers, DevOps, Programmers

## Welcome to Implementation Level

This level contains step-by-step guides, code examples, and implementation details. We show you exactly HOW TO build, test, and deploy HAL9.

## Who Should Read This Level

- **Developers** writing code
- **Engineers** implementing features
- **DevOps** deploying systems
- **QA Engineers** testing implementation
- **Contractors** building components

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Documents

All documents prefixed with L2_ including:
- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Code examples and snippets
- Build and deployment instructions
- Testing procedures
- Migration guides

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **Code Examples** - Actual implementation
- **Build Steps** - How to compile and package
- **Test Procedures** - How to verify
- **Deployment** - How to release
- **Debugging** - How to fix issues

## Implementation Standards

1. **Follow Examples** - Use provided code patterns
2. **Test Everything** - Write tests first
3. **Document Code** - Comment complex logic
4. **Handle Errors** - Never ignore failures
5. **Optimize Later** - Make it work first

## What NOT to EXPECT

- Architectural philosophy
- Business strategy
- High-level design
- Marketing materials
- Theoretical concepts

## Navigation

- **Design Specs**: [L3 Design](../L3_design/)
- **Quick Start**: [L1 Operational](../L1_operational/)
- **Architecture**: [L4 Architecture](../L4_architecture/)

## Code Organization

```
src/
├── lib.rs          # Main library
├── neurons/        # Neuron implementations
├── protocols/      # Protocol implementations
├── substrate/      # Infrastructure code
└── tests/          # Test suites
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Read Design** - Understand L3 specifications
2. **Write Tests** - TDD approach
3. **Implement** - Follow patterns
4. **Verify** - Run test suite
5. **Deploy** - Follow deployment guide

## Common Tasks

- **Add a feature** → See implementation guides
- **Fix a bug** → See debugging guides
- **Write tests** → See testing guides
- **Deploy code** → See deployment guides

## Contributing to L2

When contributing:
1. Include working code
2. Add tests
3. Document steps
4. Handle errors
5. Follow style guide
