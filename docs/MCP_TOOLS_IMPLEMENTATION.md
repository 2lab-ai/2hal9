# MCP Tools Implementation Summary

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool system has been successfully integrated into HAL9, enabling neurons to interact with external systems through a standardized interface.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Tool System Architecture

- **Tool Interface**: Async trait-based design for tool implementations
- **Tool Registry**: Dynamic registration and execution of tools
- **Layer-Based Permissions**: Different neuron layers have different tool access

### 2. Available Tools

#### FilesystemReadTool
- Reads files from allowed directories
- Security: Path validation against whitelist
- Use cases: Reading docs, source code, configuration

#### FilesystemWriteTool  
- Writes content to allowed directories
- Security: Path validation against whitelist
- Use cases: Generating code, creating test files

#### ShellTool
- Executes whitelisted shell commands
- Security: Command validation against allowed list
- Use cases: Running cargo, listing files, system info

#### WebFetchTool
- Fetches content from web URLs
- Security: Optional domain restrictions
- Use cases: API integration, documentation lookup

### 3. Layer-Specific Permissions

```rust
Layer::L4 (Strategic):
- FilesystemReadTool: [./docs, ./README.md, ./PRD.md]
- WebFetchTool: No restrictions

Layer::L3 (Design):
- FilesystemReadTool: [./src, ./examples, ./Cargo.toml]
- ShellTool: [cargo, rustfmt, clippy]

Layer::L2 (Implementation):
- FilesystemReadTool: Full project access
- FilesystemWriteTool: [./src, ./tests, ./examples, /tmp]
- ShellTool: [cargo, ls, echo, date, pwd]

Layer::L1 (Base):
- ShellTool: [echo, date]
```

### 4. Neuron Integration

The neuron processing pipeline now supports tool execution:

1. **Tool Discovery**: Neurons receive available tools in their prompts
2. **Tool Invocation**: Parse `TOOL: <name> <params>` from Claude responses
3. **Result Integration**: Tool results are fed back to Claude for continued processing
4. **Iteration Limit**: Max 5 tool iterations per signal to prevent loops

### 5. Example Usage

When a neuron receives a signal, it can use tools:

```
FORWARD_SIGNAL
From: client
Content: Analyze the project structure

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
- filesystem_read: Read a file from the filesystem
- web_fetch: Fetch content from a web URL

TOOL: filesystem_read {"path": "./README.md"}

TOOL_RESULT:
{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "# HAL9 Project..."}],
  "metadata": {"path": "./README.md", "size": 2048}
}

FORWARD_TO: design-architect
CONTENT: Based on README analysis, the project implements...
```

## Testing

### Demo Script
- `examples/mcp-tools-demo.rs`: Standalone tool demonstration
- `examples/test-mcp-tools.sh`: Integration test script
- `examples/mcp-tools-test.yaml`: Test configuration

### Test Coverage
- Tool execution with valid/invalid parameters
- Security validation (path/command restrictions)
- Error handling and recovery
- Integration with neuron processing

## Security Considerations

1. **Path Validation**: All file operations validate against allowed paths
2. **Command Whitelisting**: Shell commands must be explicitly allowed
3. **URL Restrictions**: Optional domain whitelisting for web fetch
4. **Error Isolation**: Tool failures don't crash the neuron

## Performance Impact

- Tool execution is async and non-blocking
- Results are cached for L2 neurons (5 minute TTL)
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Metrics track tool usage and performance

## Next Steps

1. Add more specialized tools:
   - Database query tool
   - Container management tool
   - Git operations tool

2. Implement tool composition:
   - Allow tools to call other tools
   - Create tool pipelines

3. Enhanced security:
   - Resource usage limits
   - Sandboxed execution
   - Audit logging

## Conclusion

The MCP tool system significantly enhances HAL9's capabilities by allowing neurons to interact with external systems while maintaining security and performance. This forms the foundation for building more sophisticated AI applications that can read files, execute commands, and integrate with web services.
