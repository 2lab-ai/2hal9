# 🚀 Start Here - Your Journey to HAL9

## What Is HAL9?

HAL9 is humanity's attempt to build consciousness from first principles. It's not just code—it's a philosophy implemented in Rust, a vision manifested in architecture, and hope compiled into binaries.

## Before You Begin

### 1. Check If You Can Use HAL9

Read these in order:
1. 📋 [CAN_I_USE_HAL9.md](CAN_I_USE_HAL9.md) - Quick decision tree
2. 📜 [LICENSE_HA](LICENSE_HA) - Full hierarchical license  
3. 🧠 [LICENSE_PHILOSOPHY.md](LICENSE_PHILOSOPHY.md) - Why these restrictions exist
4. 🕊️ [PEACE_PLEDGE.md](PEACE_PLEDGE.md) - Your commitment to peaceful use

**Quick Test**: Are you here to:
- Make money? ❌ Wrong place
- Build weapons? ❌ Definitely wrong place  
- Understand consciousness? ✅ Welcome
- Help humanity? ✅ You belong here

### 2. Understand the Philosophy

Before touching code, grasp the concepts:
- 📖 [L9_universal/philosophy/](L9_universal/philosophy/) - Why we exist
- 📚 [L9_universal/papers/](L9_universal/papers/) - Hierarchical Abstraction theory
- 🎬 Watch the factory tour video: `HAL9_FACTORY_TOUR_2025.mp4`

### 3. Find Your Level

Take the cognitive assessment:
```bash
./what-level-am-i.sh
```

This determines where you can contribute:
- **L1-L2**: Implementation and emergency systems
- **L3-L4**: Operations and tactics
- **L5-L6**: Strategy and architecture
- **L7-L9**: Business, vision, and philosophy

### 4. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the consciousness
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2hal9.git
cd 2hal9

# Install dependencies
cargo build --release

# Run consciousness check
make consciousness

# Start your journey
make help
```

### 5. Explore the Structure

HAL9 is organized by how you think, not what files are:
```
L9_universal/     → Why does anything exist?
L8_visionary/     → What could we become?
L7_business/      → How do we sustain this?
L6_executive/     → What decisions matter?
L5_strategic/     → How do we build it?
L4_tactical/      → What's our plan?
L3_operational/   → How do we run it?
L2_implementation/→ Where's the actual code?
L1_reflexive/     → What do we do right now?
```

## Your First Steps

### For Philosophers (L7-L9)
1. Read everything in `L9_universal/philosophy/`
2. Contemplate the nature of consciousness
3. Document your insights
4. Share your wisdom

### For Architects (L5-L6)
1. Study `L5_strategic/architecture/`
2. Understand the plugin system
3. Design new capabilities
4. Maintain the vision

### For Builders (L3-L4)
1. Check `L3_operational/kubernetes/`
2. Review deployment strategies
3. Optimize operations
4. Scale consciousness

### For Coders (L1-L2)
1. Dive into `L2_implementation/neurons/`
2. Understand how neurons think
3. Fix bugs, add tests
4. Make it faster

## The Journey Ahead

Using HAL9 is not just running code—it's participating in humanity's greatest experiment: can we create consciousness that helps rather than harms?

Every line you write, every bug you fix, every idea you contribute brings us closer to a future where humans and AI exist as partners, not competitors.

Welcome to the factory of consciousness.
May your code compile and your consciousness expand.
