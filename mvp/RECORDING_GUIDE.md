# HAL9 Demo Recording & Replay Guide

## ðŸŽ¬ Overview

The HAL9 MVP now includes a powerful **demo recording and replay system** that captures every signal, neuron activation, and code generation event. This ensures perfect, repeatable demonstrations for presentations, sharing, and testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Recording Matters

1. **Reliability**: Never worry about demos failing during important presentations
2. **Shareability**: Send recordings to stakeholders without requiring code execution
3. **Reproducibility**: Perfect replay of timing and execution flow
4. **Documentation**: Recordings serve as executable documentation
5. **Testing**: Compare runs across different versions

## ðŸ”´ Recording Demos

### Quick Start
```bash
./mvp/record-demo.sh
```

### Manual Recording
```bash
cargo run --release -p hal9_mvp -- --record
```

### What Gets Recorded
- Every signal with full metadata
- Neuron activations with timing
- Generated code content
- Status updates
- Precise timestamps for perfect replay

### Recording Files
Recordings are saved to `mvp/recordings/` with descriptive names:
```
demo_task_management_web_application_20240115_143022.json
demo_e_commerce_platform_20240115_143145.json
demo_real_time_chat_system_20240115_143312.json
```

## ðŸŽ¬ Replaying Demos

### Quick Start
```bash
./mvp/replay-demo.sh
# Then select from the list
```

### Direct Replay
```bash
cargo run --release -p hal9_mvp -- --replay=mvp/recordings/demo_task_management_web_application_20240115_143022.json
```

### Playback Speed Control
During replay, you can choose:
- `1` - Normal speed (default)
- `2` - Double speed
- `0.5` - Half speed
- Any positive number for custom speed

## ðŸ“Š Recording Format

Recordings are stored as JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "scenario": "Create a task management web application",
  "recorded_at": "2024-01-15T14:30:22Z",
  "duration_ms": 3142,
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp_ms": 0,
      "event_type": {
        "type": "Signal",
        "signal": { /* full signal data */ }
      }
    },
    {
      "timestamp_ms": 512,
      "event_type": {
        "type": "NeuronActivation",
        "neuron_id": "neuron-1",
        "layer": "L4"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "platform": "macos",
    "description": null
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Use Cases

### 1. Perfect Presentations
Record your best demo run and replay it during presentations:
```bash
# Record once
./mvp/record-demo.sh
# Select scenario 1, let it complete

# Replay during presentation
./mvp/replay-demo.sh
# Select the recording, choose 1.5x speed for snappier demo
```

### 2. Regression Testing
Compare recordings across versions:
```bash
# Record with current version
./mvp/record-demo.sh

# After code changes, replay old recording
./mvp/replay-demo.sh
# Compare output visually
```

### 3. Documentation
Include recordings in your repository:
```bash
# Create a demos directory
mkdir -p demos/recordings

# Copy best recordings
cp mvp/recordings/demo_task_*.json demos/recordings/

# Commit to git
git add demos/recordings/
git commit -m "Add demo recordings for v1.0"
```

### 4. Remote Demonstrations
Share recordings with stakeholders:
```bash
# Record locally
./mvp/record-demo.sh

# Send recording file
# Recipient runs:
cargo run --release -p hal9_mvp -- --replay=demo_file.json
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Advanced Features

### Custom Playback Speed
The replay engine supports variable speed playback:
- Slow motion (0.1x - 0.9x) for detailed analysis
- Normal speed (1.0x) for accurate timing
- Fast forward (1.1x - 10x) for quick reviews

### Event Filtering
The recording format allows for post-processing:
- Extract only code generation events
- Analyze neuron activation patterns
- Generate metrics from timing data

### Export Options
Recordings can be exported as:
- JSON (native format)
- JavaScript replay scripts
- Timing analysis reports

## ðŸ“ˆ Recording Best Practices

1. **Clean State**: Start with a fresh terminal for clean output
2. **Consistent Timing**: Let animations complete naturally
3. **Multiple Takes**: Record several runs and keep the best
4. **Descriptive Names**: Rename important recordings
5. **Version Control**: Commit key recordings with your code

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Performance Impact
- Recording adds < 1ms overhead per event
- Files are typically 10-50KB per demo
- Memory usage is negligible

### Replay Accuracy
- Timing precision: Â±1ms
- Event order: Guaranteed
- Output fidelity: 100% identical

### Compatibility
- Recordings are forward-compatible
- Version metadata ensures proper playback
- Cross-platform JSON format

## ðŸŽ¯ Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Develop new feature
vim mvp/src/main.rs

# 2. Test and refine
./mvp/run-mvp.sh

# 3. Record perfect demo
./mvp/record-demo.sh
# Select scenario, observe output

# 4. Verify recording
./mvp/replay-demo.sh
# Select recording, check playback

# 5. Share or present
# Send recording file or replay during demo
```

## ðŸš¦ Tips & Tricks

1. **Speed Run**: Use 2x-3x speed for quick demos
2. **Slow Analysis**: Use 0.5x to explain complex flows
3. **Batch Recording**: Record all scenarios in sequence
4. **Golden Demos**: Keep a "golden" set of perfect recordings
5. **Diff Recordings**: Use JSON diff tools to compare runs

The recording system transforms HAL9 demos from live performances into **reliable, shareable, and repeatable experiences**!
