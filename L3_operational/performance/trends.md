## Production Learnings

### The Hard Way Lessons

1. **"Just 3 replicas" doesn't work**
   - Started with 3, crashed at 200 users
   - Now: 30 baseline, scales to 150

2. **The database is always the bottleneck**
   - Connection pooling is critical
   - Read replicas are necessary at scale
   - Prepared statements save 20% query time

3. **Memory limits matter**
   - Java developers cry but 2Gi is real
   - OOM killer is unforgiving
   - 4Gi limit prevents cascading failures

4. **Port conflicts at 3am**
   - Created emergency-port-conflict.sh
   - Automated in emergency-restart-hal9.sh
   - Always check what's on 8080

### Scaling Observations

#### 100 Users
- 3 pods sufficient
- 1 CPU, 1Gi memory each
- Simple round-robin works

#### 500 Users
- 15 pods minimum
- Connection pooling critical
- Need session affinity

#### 1000+ Users
- 30 pods baseline
- 2 CPU, 4Gi memory limits
- Advanced autoscaling required
- Redis cache mandatory
- Database read replicas

#### 5000+ Users (Projected)
- 100+ pods
- Multi-region deployment
- CDN for static assets
- GraphQL federation

## Performance Patterns

### Traffic Patterns
```
Peak Hours: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM, 7-9 PM
Low Hours: 2-6 AM
Spike Pattern: Monday mornings (+200%)
```

### Resource Usage Patterns
```
Memory: Gradual increase, sharp drops after GC
CPU: Spiky during neural processing
Network: Consistent 100Mbps baseline
Disk I/O: Minimal except during logs rotation
```

## Bottleneck Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Claude API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Aggressive caching, request batching
   
2. **Database Write Performance**
   - Mitigation: Async writes, batch inserts
   
3. **Embedding Generation**
   - Mitigation: Pre-compute common embeddings

### Resolved Bottlenecks
1. ~~Port conflicts~~ → emergency scripts
2. ~~Memory leaks~~ → fixed in v1.0.1
3. ~~Connection exhaustion~~ → pooling implemented

## Cost Optimization

### Monthly Costs (1000 users)
- Compute: $2,400 (30 pods × 2 CPU)
- Memory: $1,800 (30 pods × 4Gi)
- Storage: $300 (logs, metrics)
- Network: $500 (egress)
- Claude API: $3,000 (after caching)
- **Total**: ~$8,000/month

### Cost Savings Implemented
1. Spot instances for non-critical workloads: -30%
2. Reserved instances for baseline: -25%
3. Caching reduced API calls: -40%
4. Right-sizing pods: -15%

## Future Optimizations

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement request coalescing
2. Add circuit breakers for all external calls
3. Optimize Docker image size
4. Enable HTTP/2 and gRPC

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. Migrate to Rust async runtime optimizations
2. Implement custom memory allocator
3. Add predictive autoscaling
4. Database sharding

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. Multi-region active-active deployment
2. Edge computing for latency reduction
3. Custom neural network accelerators
4. Quantum-ready architecture (시발 진짜?)

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **P99 Latency** > 500ms
2. **Error Rate** > 1%
3. **CPU Usage** > 80%
4. **Memory Usage** > 90%
5. **Active Connections** > 8000
6. **Cache Hit Rate** < 30%

### Alert Fatigue Reduction
- Removed: CPU spike alerts (too noisy)
- Kept: Sustained high CPU (5 min average)
- Added: Predictive alerts for scaling
- Tuned: Error rate threshold from 0.1% to 1%

## Operational Wisdom

> "It works on my machine" !== production ready

> "We'll optimize later" === technical debt forever

> "Just restart it" is valid at 3am

> "Add more logging" is always correct until disk full

> "Cache invalidation" remains one of two hard problems

## Performance Testing Results

## Lessons for New Operators

1. **Always have rollback ready**
   - Rollback scripts are tested monthly
   - Snapshots before every change
   - Practice rollbacks in staging

2. **Monitor what matters**
   - User-facing metrics first
   - Resource metrics second
   - Vanity metrics never

3. **Automate everything**
   - If you do it twice, script it
   - If it fails once, add monitoring
   - If it pages you, add self-healing

4. **Trust but verify**
   - Health checks lie
   - Metrics can be wrong
   - Always have manual checks

5. **Performance is a feature**
   - Users notice 100ms
   - 1 second feels like forever
   - Optimize the critical path

## Appendix: Magic Numbers

These numbers work in production:

```yaml
replicas: 30                    # For 1000+ users
cpu_request: 1                  # Actually 1 core
memory_request: 2Gi             # Minimum viable
memory_limit: 4Gi               # OOM prevention
connection_pool: 100            # Database connections
cache_size: 50000               # Entries
rate_limit: 1000               # Requests per second
timeout: 30s                    # API timeout
graceful_shutdown: 60s          # Drain time
```
