# HAL9 Codebase Reorganization - Hierarchical Abstraction Principles

## Vision

Reorganize the entire HAL9 codebase so that each level of the Hierarchical Abstraction (HA) system "feels at home" - where navigation doesn't require cognitive level switching and each abstraction level is self-contained.

## Core Principles

1. **Cognitive Level Isolation**: Each directory represents a single cognitive level
2. **No Forced Switching**: You should never need to jump abstraction levels to find related content
3. **Self-Contained Levels**: Everything needed at a cognitive level lives together
4. **Clear Dependencies**: Higher levels depend on lower, never the reverse
5. **Hidden Infrastructure**: Technical necessities that don't fit the hierarchy are hidden

## Benefits of New Organization

### For Each Cognitive Level

**L1 (Reflexive)**
- Operators find all health checks and emergency procedures immediately
- No need to understand implementation details
- Quick access to status and monitoring

**L2 (Implementation)**
- Developers work entirely within their cognitive space
- Tests, code, and validation together
- No distraction from strategic documents

**L3 (Operational)**
- Architects see all design decisions in one place
- Configuration and architecture co-located
- Clear view of system structure

**L4 (Tactical)**
- Planners access all strategies and analysis together
- Performance and scaling decisions unified
- No mixing with implementation details

**L5 (Strategic)**
- Technical leaders see vision and innovation clearly
- Research and evolution planning together
- Separated from day-to-day operations

**L6 (Executive)**
- Executives get clear overviews without technical depth
- Metrics and decisions at appropriate abstraction
- Communication materials readily available

**L7-L9 (Business/Visionary/Universal)**
- Each level maintains its temporal scope
- No contamination with implementation concerns
- Pure focus on appropriate abstraction

### System Benefits

1. **Cognitive Flow**: Navigate without switching mental models
2. **Self-Documentation**: Structure itself explains the system
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Each level only sees what it needs
4. **Natural Boundaries**: Clear interfaces between levels
5. **Emergent Understanding**: Higher levels naturally emerge from lower

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create New Structure
```bash
# Create all L* directories
for level in L{1..9}_{reflexive,implementation,operational,tactical,strategic,executive,business,visionary,universal}; do
  mkdir -p $level
done

# Create substrate and membrane
mkdir -p substrate membrane .substrate
```

### Phase 2: Migration Scripts
Create migration scripts that preserve git history while moving files to their new cognitive homes.

### Phase 3: Update References
Update all internal references, imports, and documentation links.

### Phase 4: Validation
Ensure the system still builds and runs with the new structure.

## Conclusion

This reorganization transforms the codebase from a technically-organized collection into a cognitively-organized system where each level of abstraction has a natural home. The structure itself becomes a teacher, guiding users to the appropriate cognitive level for their current needs.
