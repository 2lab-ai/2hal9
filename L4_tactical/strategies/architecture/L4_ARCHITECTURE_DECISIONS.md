# HAL9 Architecture Decision Records

**Level**: L4 Architectural  
**Audience**: Architects, Tech Leads, Senior Engineers  
**Purpose**: Document key architectural decisions and rationale

## ADR-001: Hierarchical Layer Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Need to build a scalable AI system capable of emergent intelligence.

### Decision
Implement a 5-layer hierarchical architecture with clean abstraction boundaries.

### Rationale
- Biological systems use hierarchy for complexity management
- Enables independent evolution of layers
- Allows emergent behaviors
- Provides clear mental model

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Scalable, evolvable, emergent capabilities
- **Negative**: Initial complexity, refactoring effort

## ADR-002: Rust as Primary Language

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: December 2024

### Context
Need a language that provides performance, safety, and concurrency.

### Decision
Use Rust for all core system components.

### Rationale
- Memory safety without GC
- Excellent async support
- Strong type system
- Performance comparable to C++
- Growing ecosystem

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Safety, performance, modern tooling
- **Negative**: Steeper learning curve, smaller talent pool

## ADR-003: Actor Model for Neurons

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Neurons need to process messages concurrently and maintain state.

### Decision
Implement neurons as actors using Tokio async tasks.

### Rationale
- Natural fit for message-passing architecture
- Inherent concurrency
- Fault isolation
- Location transparency

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Scalable, fault-tolerant, distributable
- **Negative**: Message ordering complexity, debugging challenges

## ADR-004: Event Sourcing for State

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Need to track system evolution and enable time-travel debugging.

### Decision
Use event sourcing for critical state changes.

### Rationale
- Complete audit trail
- Replay capabilities
- Temporal queries
- Distributed consistency

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Debuggability, audit trail, replay
- **Negative**: Storage overhead, complexity

---

## ADR-005: Substrate Abstraction Layer

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
System needs to run on various infrastructure types.

### Decision
Abstract runtime, transport, and storage behind substrate traits.

### Rationale
- Infrastructure independence
- Easy testing with mocks
- Future-proof for new technologies
- Clean separation of concerns

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Flexibility, testability, portability
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer

---

## ADR-006: GraphQL for External API

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: December 2024

### Context
Need flexible API for various client types.

### Decision
Use GraphQL for client-facing API, internal gRPC.

### Rationale
- Client-driven queries
- Strong typing
- Built-in introspection
- Subscription support

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Flexible, efficient, self-documenting
- **Negative**: Complexity, N+1 query risks

---

## ADR-007: Capability-Based Security

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Need fine-grained security without complex ACLs.

### Decision
Implement capability-based security model.

### Rationale
- Principle of least privilege
- Composable permissions
- No ambient authority
- Delegatable

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Secure, flexible, auditable
- **Negative**: Different mental model, education needed

---

## ADR-008: Gradual Migration Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Cannot rewrite entire system at once.

### Decision
Use feature flags and compatibility layers for gradual migration.

### Rationale
- Reduces risk
- Maintains system availability
- Allows rollback
- Enables A/B testing

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Low risk, continuous delivery
- **Negative**: Temporary complexity, longer timeline

---

## ADR-009: PostgreSQL for Distributed State

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: December 2024

### Context
Need distributed, consistent state storage.

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL as primary distributed state store.

### Rationale
- Battle-tested
- ACID compliance
- Rich querying
- Extension ecosystem

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Reliable, feature-rich, well-understood
- **Negative**: Not infinitely scalable, operational complexity

---

## ADR-010: WASM for Plugins

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025

### Context
Need safe plugin execution with multiple language support.

### Decision
Use WebAssembly for plugin system.

### Rationale
- Sandboxed execution
- Language agnostic
- Deterministic
- Growing ecosystem

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Safe, portable, multi-language
- **Negative**: Performance overhead, limited system access

---
