# L4: System Architecture Documentation

**Abstraction Level**: L4 - System Architecture  
**Audience**: System Architects, Technical Leads, Senior Engineers

## Welcome to Architecture Level

This level contains system architecture, design patterns, and architectural decisions. We define how the system is structured and why.

## Who Should Read This Level

- **System Architects** designing large systems
- **Technical Leads** making design decisions
- **Senior Engineers** understanding system structure
- **DevOps Architects** planning deployment
- **Security Architects** designing security layers

## What You'll Find Here

### Core Documents

All documents prefixed with L4_ including:
- System architecture specifications
- Design patterns and principles
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Component relationships
- Scaling strategies

## Key Concepts at This Level

- **System Design** - How components fit together
- **Design Patterns** - Reusable architectural solutions
- **Quality Attributes** - Performance, scalability, security
- **Trade-offs** - Architectural decisions and rationale
- **Evolution** - How architecture adapts

## Architectural Principles

1. **Hierarchical Layers** - Each layer has clear purpose
2. **Clean Interfaces** - Well-defined boundaries
3. **Loose Coupling** - Minimal dependencies
4. **High Cohesion** - Related functionality together
5. **Emergent Behavior** - Simple rules, complex outcomes

## System Layers

```
Intelligence Layer
Orchestration Layer
Cognitive Layer
Protocol Layer
Substrate Layer
```

## What NOT to Expect

- Business strategy
- Implementation code
- Operational procedures
- Marketing content
- Daily tasks

## Navigation

- **Technical Strategy**: [L5 Technical Strategy](../L5_technical_strategy/)
- **Detailed Design**: [L3 Design](../L3_design/)
- **Implementation**: [L2 Implementation](../L2_implementation/)

## Architectural Views

At L4, we document:
- **Logical View** - Functional decomposition
- **Process View** - Runtime behavior
- **Development View** - Code organization
- **Physical View** - Deployment topology
- **Scenarios** - Use cases driving design

## Quality Attributes

Focus areas:
- **Performance** - <10ms layer latency
- **Scalability** - 10,000+ neurons
- **Reliability** - 99.99% uptime
- **Security** - Defense in depth
- **Maintainability** - Modular design

## Contributing to L4

When contributing:
1. Document ADRs for decisions
2. Include diagrams
3. Explain trade-offs
4. Consider all views
5. Think long-term impact
