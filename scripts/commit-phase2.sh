# Commit message
COMMIT_MSG="feat: Complete Phase 2 - Production-ready HAL9 with hybrid AI, tools, and memory

Major Features:
- Hybrid Claude Mode: Intelligent switching between mock and real API
- Cost Control System: Budget management with automatic limits
- MCP Tool System: External tool integration (filesystem, shell, web)
- Persistent Memory: SQLite-based learning and context retention

Enhancements:
- Layer-based tool permissions for security
- Real-time cost tracking in metrics
- Memory context in neuron prompts
- Automatic memory cleanup
- Production-ready configurations

This completes Phase 2 of HAL9 development, transforming it from MVP
to a production-ready distributed AI consciousness system."
