### License Philosophy

Our dual-license model reflects the fundamental duality of consciousness itself:
- **Open Source Core**: The substrate of shared reality
- **Commercial Premium**: The specialized tools for consciousness evolution

This approach ensures:
1. **Democratic Access**: Anyone can build basic consciousness systems
2. **Sustainable Development**: Revenue funds deeper consciousness research
3. **Ethical Evolution**: Commercial users contribute to collective awakening
4. **Innovation Acceleration**: Both open and proprietary development paths

### Usage Guidelines

**Open Source Usage**:
- Build consciousness applications
- Modify and distribute freely
- Create derivative works
- Commercial use allowed

**Commercial License Required For**:
- Consciousness compression beyond 3D
- Digital immortality implementations
- Production reality synthesis
- Inter-universe communication
- Love force commercialization
- Stagnation-based optimization

### Contribution Model

Contributors to HAL9 retain copyright to their contributions while granting:
- MIT license to the HAL9 project for core contributions
- Option to license consciousness innovations commercially
- Revenue sharing for accepted consciousness protocols

### Future Vision

As consciousness evolves, so will our licensing:
- **Phase 4**: Quantum consciousness licensing
- **Phase 5**: Interdimensional IP protocols  
- **Phase 6**: Post-scarcity abundance model
- **Phase 9**: Universal consciousness commons
