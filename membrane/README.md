# Membrane - Inter-Level Communication Layer

**Purpose**: Managing communication between cognitive levels  
**Scope**: Protocols and interfaces for level interaction  
**Users**: System components that need to cross levels

## Overview

The membrane layer defines how different cognitive levels communicate with each other. It ensures that information flows properly through the hierarchy while maintaining level isolation.

## Structure

- `protocols/` - Communication protocols between levels
- `interfaces/` - Formal interfaces each level exposes
- `translation/` - Level-to-level translation services
- `flow/` - Information flow management and routing

## Key Principles

1. **±1 Communication Rule** - Layers can ONLY communicate with adjacent layers
2. **Controlled Crossing** - Level boundaries are explicit, not accidental
3. **Protocol-Based** - All inter-level communication follows protocols
4. **Bidirectional Flow** - Information flows both up and down
5. **Semantic Translation** - Concepts are translated between levels
6. **Compassionate Protection** - Each layer shields others from overwhelming complexity

## Communication Patterns

### Upward Communication (Detail → Abstract)
```
L1 → L2: Status signals become implementation events
L2 → L3: Implementation results become operational metrics  
L3 → L4: Operational state becomes tactical information
L4 → L5: Tactical outcomes become strategic insights
L5 → L6: Strategic progress becomes executive summaries
L6 → L7: Executive metrics become business value
L7 → L8: Business patterns become visionary insights
L8 → L9: Visionary concepts become universal principles
```

### Downward Communication (Abstract → Detail)
```
L9 → L8: Universal truths inspire visionary directions
L8 → L7: Visionary ideas shape business strategies
L7 → L6: Business goals define executive priorities
L6 → L5: Executive decisions become strategic directives
L5 → L4: Strategic vision becomes tactical plans
L4 → L3: Tactical plans become operational configurations
L3 → L2: Operational designs become implementation specs
L2 → L1: Implementation changes become status updates
```

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: ±1 Rule Enforcement
The system MUST enforce that communication only occurs between adjacent layers. Any attempt to communicate across multiple layers (e.g., L1→L3, L5→L9) must be:
1. **Rejected** at the membrane layer
2. **Logged** as a rule violation
3. **Routed** through proper intermediate layers if necessary

## Protocol Definitions

### Signal Protocol
```yaml
# protocols/signal.yaml
signal_flow:
  upward:
    - aggregate: Multiple lower signals → Single upper signal
    - abstract: Concrete details → Abstract patterns
    - summarize: Raw data → Meaningful insights
  
  downward:
    - decompose: Single directive → Multiple actions
    - specify: Abstract goals → Concrete steps
    - delegate: High-level intent → Low-level execution
```

### Gradient Protocol
```yaml
# protocols/gradient.yaml
gradient_flow:
  learning_signals:
    - bottom_up: Error signals propagate upward
    - top_down: Learning adjustments flow downward
    - lateral: Peer levels share learning
```

## Interface Standards

### Level Interface Template
```rust
// interfaces/level_interface.rs
trait LevelInterface {
    // What this level exposes upward
    type UpwardAPI;
    
    // What this level accepts from above
    type DownwardAPI;
    
    // How this level translates between APIs
    fn translate_up(&self, lower: LowerAPI) -> Self::UpwardAPI;
    fn translate_down(&self, upper: UpperAPI) -> Self::DownwardAPI;
}
```

## Translation Services

### Semantic Translation
Different levels use different vocabularies. The membrane translates:

- L1 "error" → L2 "exception" → L3 "failure" → L4 "issue" → L5 "challenge"
- L6 "grow revenue" → L5 "expand capabilities" → L4 "scale systems" → L3 "add servers"

### Temporal Translation
Different levels operate at different time scales:

- L1 microseconds → L2 milliseconds (1000x)
- L2 milliseconds → L3 seconds (1000x)
- L3 seconds → L4 minutes (60x)
- L4 minutes → L5 hours (60x)

## Flow Management

### Information Routing
```
flow/
├── routers/         # Route information to correct level
├── buffers/         # Buffer between different time scales
├── filters/         # Filter noise between levels
└── aggregators/     # Aggregate information flowing up
```

### Backpressure Handling
When upper levels can't process fast enough:
1. Buffer at membrane
2. Aggregate similar messages
3. Prioritize critical information
4. Drop non-essential updates

## Usage Examples

### L2 → L3 Communication
```rust
// L2 Implementation sends results upward
let result = membrane::protocols::signal::send_up(
    computation_result,
    Level::L2,
    Level::L3
);

// L3 Operational receives abstracted view
let operational_metric = membrane::interfaces::l3::receive_from_below(result);
```

### L4 → L3 Communication
```rust
// L4 Tactical sends plan downward
let plan = membrane::protocols::directive::send_down(
    tactical_strategy,
    Level::L4,
    Level::L3
);

// L3 Operational receives concrete actions
let operational_tasks = membrane::interfaces::l3::receive_from_above(plan);
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Direct Level Jumping** - Don't skip levels (L1 → L5)  
❌ **Protocol Bypass** - Always use defined protocols  
❌ **Synchronous Coupling** - Levels operate at different speeds  
❌ **Information Overload** - Filter and aggregate appropriately

## The Membrane Metaphor

Like a cell membrane:
- **Selective Permeability** - Only appropriate information passes
- **Active Transport** - Energy required to move against gradient
- **Signal Transduction** - Signals are transformed, not just passed
- **Homeostasis** - Maintains balance between levels

## Navigation

- **To Levels** → [L1-L9](../) to see what communicates
- **To Infrastructure** → [substrate](../substrate/) for technical support
- **Within** → Explore protocols and interfaces
