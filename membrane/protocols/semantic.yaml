  description: Rules for meaning preservation
  
  upward:
    - name: Abstraction
      from: concrete details
      to: general patterns
      example:
        L2: "null pointer at line 423"
        L3: "data validation error"
        L4: "input handling flaw"
    
    - name: Aggregation
      from: multiple instances
      to: single concept
      example:
        L1: ["timeout", "timeout", "timeout"]
        L2: "connection issues"
        L3: "network problems"
    
    - name: Generalization
      from: specific case
      to: broad principle
      example:
        L3: "user authentication failed"
        L4: "security concern"
        L5: "trust architecture"
  
  downward:
    - name: Specification
      from: general intent
      to: specific action
      example:
        L5: "improve user experience"
        L4: "reduce latency"
        L3: "optimize database queries"
    
    - name: Decomposition
      from: single concept
      to: multiple tasks
      example:
        L6: "increase reliability"
        L5: "implement redundancy"
        L4: ["add backups", "enable failover", "monitor health"]
    
    - name: Instantiation
      from: abstract principle
      to: concrete implementation
      example:
        L7: "customer first"
        L6: "improve support response"
        L5: "24/7 operations"
