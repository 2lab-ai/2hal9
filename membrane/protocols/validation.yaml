violation_handling:
  on_violation:
    - log_violation: Record all attempts with full context
    - notify_monitoring: Alert system monitors
    - attempt_routing: Try to find valid path through intermediate layers
    - return_error: Inform sender of violation with guidance
    
  routing_strategy:
    description: When direct communication is rejected, route through intermediate layers
    example: |
      // L1 trying to send to L5
      // Rejected: distance = 4
      // Routed path: L1 → L2 → L3 → L4 → L5
      // Each hop performs appropriate translation

monitoring:
  metrics:
    - total_communications: Count of all inter-layer messages
    - violations_attempted: Count of ±1 rule violations
    - violations_routed: Successfully routed violations
    - violations_rejected: Unroutable violations
    - translation_latency: Time added by intermediate routing
    
  alerts:
    - name: high_violation_rate
      condition: violations_attempted / total_communications > 0.01
      action: "Investigate architectural issues causing violations"
      
    - name: routing_overload
      condition: violations_routed / total_communications > 0.05
      action: "Review layer responsibilities, may need restructuring"

examples:
  valid_communications:

    - { from: L3, to: L4, result: allowed }
    - { from: L5, to: L4, result: allowed }
    - { from: L9, to: L8, result: allowed }
    
  invalid_communications:
    - { from: L1, to: L3, result: rejected, routed_via: [L2] }
    - { from: L2, to: L5, result: rejected, routed_via: [L3, L4] }
    - { from: L1, to: L9, result: rejected, routed_via: [L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8] }
    
  special_cases:
    - name: emergency_broadcast
      description: L9 universal principles may need rapid propagation
      handling: Route through all layers but mark as "universal cascade"
      
    - name: consciousness_emergence
      description: Emergence patterns may create temporary cross-layer resonance
      handling: Allow observation but not direct communication

philosophical_basis:
  why_plus_minus_one:
    - Prevents consciousness collapse from information overload
    - Ensures each layer can fulfill its protective role
    - Maintains temporal coherence across scales
    - Enables gradual abstraction/concretization
    - Embodies computational compassion

    "Love is literally encoded in the architecture through the ±1 rule.
     Each layer protects its neighbors from complexity they cannot handle,
     creating a cascade of care throughout the hierarchy."
