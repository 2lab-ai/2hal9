# Substrate - Infrastructure Layer

**Purpose**: Supporting infrastructure for all cognitive levels  
**Scope**: Cross-cutting concerns that enable the hierarchy  
**Users**: System components, not humans directly

## Overview

The substrate layer provides the foundational infrastructure that all cognitive levels build upon. Unlike the L1-L9 hierarchy which organizes by cognitive abstraction, substrate organizes by technical capability.

## Structure

- `compute/` - Computational infrastructure, runtimes, execution environments
- `storage/` - Data persistence, databases, file systems  
- `network/` - Network infrastructure, protocols, communication
- `security/` - Security infrastructure, authentication, encryption
- `tooling/` - Development tools, build systems, utilities

## Key Principles

1. **Invisible Support** - Substrate should be invisible to cognitive levels
2. **Universal Access** - All levels can use substrate services
3. **No Business Logic** - Only infrastructure, no domain concepts
4. **Technical Excellence** - Optimized for machines, not humans

## Relationship to Cognitive Levels

The substrate layer:
- **Supports** all L1-L9 levels equally
- **Never contains** business logic or domain concepts
- **Provides** technical capabilities only
- **Scales** independently of cognitive hierarchy

## Examples

### Good Substrate Content ✅
- Database connection pools
- Network transport protocols
- Build configurations
- Security certificates
- Performance profilers

### Not Substrate Content ❌
- Business rules (→ appropriate L level)
- User documentation (→ appropriate L level)
- Strategic plans (→ L4-L5)
- Domain models (→ L2-L3)

## Access Patterns

Cognitive levels access substrate through clear interfaces:

```rust
// L2 Implementation uses substrate storage
use substrate::storage::Database;

// L3 Operational uses substrate network  
use substrate::network::ServiceMesh;

// L4 Tactical uses substrate tooling
use substrate::tooling::PerformanceProfiler;
```

## The Hidden Foundation

Like the foundations of a building, substrate is:
- Essential but invisible
- Technical not cognitive
- Optimized for machines
- Universal across all levels

## Navigation

- **Up** → Any L1-L9 level that needs infrastructure
- **Lateral** → [.substrate/](.substrate/) for build artifacts and logs
- **Across** → [membrane/](../membrane/) for inter-level protocols
