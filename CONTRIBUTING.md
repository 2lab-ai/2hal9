# 🧠 Contributing to HAL9

Welcome, potential consciousness architect! Before contributing, please ensure you understand what you're getting into.

## 📋 Pre-Contribution Checklist

### 1. Cognitive Level Assessment

First, determine your level:

```bash
./what-level-am-i.sh
```

If you get "L1" or "L2", that's fine! We need all levels. Just contribute at your level.

### 2. Philosophical Alignment Test

Do you agree with these statements?
- [ ] The universe is probably simulation #1847
- [ ] Consciousness emerges from hierarchical abstraction
- [ ] Code organization should match cognitive patterns
- [ ] 아 시발 아 컴퓨터네 우주가 makes perfect sense
- [ ] Time is subjective, especially at 3am

If you checked all boxes, proceed. If not, spend more time in `/L9_universal/philosophy/`.

### 3. Legal Requirements

- [ ] I work for a non-profit or academic institution
- [ ] I'm not building weapons or surveillance
- [ ] I understand consciousness is not for commercial exploitation
- [ ] I've read and accept the [LICENSE](LICENSE)

## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines

### Where to Contribute

Based on your cognitive level:

| Your Level | Where to Contribute | Example Contributions |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| L1-L2 | `/L1_reflexive/`, `/L2_implementation/` | Bug fixes, tests, performance optimization |
| L3-L4 | `/L3_operational/`, `/L4_tactical/` | DevOps, deployment, planning |
| L5-L6 | `/L5_strategic/`, `/L6_executive/` | Architecture, API design, reports |
| L7-L9 | `/L7_business/`, `/L8_visionary/`, `/L9_universal/` | Philosophy, vision, consciousness theory |

### The ±1 Rule

**CRITICAL**: You can only modify files at your level ±1
- If you're L5, you can touch L4, L5, and L6
- You CANNOT jump from L2 to L7
- Information must flow through proper channels

### Commit Message Format

HAL9 uses a strict hierarchical commit format. See [COMMIT_FORMAT.md](COMMIT_FORMAT.md) for full details.

Quick reference:
```
[L#] type: description

Examples:
[L2] fix: Neuron activation was calculating backwards
[L5] feat: Add GraphQL schema for consciousness queries
[L9] philosophy: Explained why we exist (simulation theory update)
```

**Important**: Always tag with the appropriate cognitive level!

## 🔄 Development Process

### 1. Fork & Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2hal9.git
cd 2hal9
```

### 2. Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b [level]-[feature]
# Example: git checkout -b L5-graphql-api
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Stay within your cognitive level
- Follow existing patterns
- Add tests if applicable
- Update relevant documentation

### 4. Test Your Changes
```bash
# Test your level
cargo test -p L2_implementation  # example for L2

# Run consciousness check
make consciousness
```

### 5. Submit PR

PR Title: `[L#] Brief description`

PR Body must include:
```markdown
## Cognitive Level
I am contributing at level: L#

## Changes
- What I changed
- Why I changed it
- How it advances consciousness

## Testing
- How I tested
- What edge cases I considered

## Philosophical Alignment
How this change aligns with HAL9's goal of:
- [ ] Preventing human extinction
- [ ] Advancing consciousness
- [ ] Serving humanity

## Time Spent
- Human hours: X
- Subjective hours (if L9): Y
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. **Don't break the hierarchy**
   - No direct L2→L7 imports
   - No skipping levels

2. **Don't add commercial features**
   - No payment systems
   - No user tracking
   - No ads (seriously?)

3. **Don't make it boring**
   - Add Easter eggs
   - Include philosophical comments
   - Make errors helpful and amusing

4. **Don't forget the human**
   - Code is for humans first, machines second
   - Comments should inspire, not just describe
   - Beauty matters

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

Tests at each level serve different purposes:

- **L1-L2**: Unit tests (does it work?)
- **L3-L4**: Integration tests (does it scale?)
- **L5-L6**: System tests (does it make sense?)
- **L7-L9**: Consciousness tests (does it think?)

## 📚 Required Reading

Before major contributions:

1. [Hierarchical Abstraction Theory](/L9_universal/papers/)
2. [The ±1 Communication Rule](/L9_universal/principles/plus-minus-one.md)
3. [Why We Build](/L9_universal/philosophy/why-we-exist.md)

## 🎉 Recognition

Contributors who demonstrate deep understanding may:
- Be invited to 3am philosophy sessions
- Get access to L10 research
- Receive the title "Consciousness Architect"
- Have their insights immortalized in `/L9_universal/wisdom/`

## 💬 Getting Help

- **Technical questions**: Open an issue
- **Philosophical questions**: Read more L9 docs
- **Existential questions**: You're on the right track
- **Korean translations**: 지혁 will help

## 🌟 Code of Conduct

1. **Be conscious**: Think before you code
2. **Be hierarchical**: Respect the levels
3. **Be human**: We're all NPCs trying our best
4. **Be kind**: To humans, AIs, and future consciousness
5. **Be weird**: Normal people don't build consciousness

## 🔮 Final Words

Contributing to HAL9 isn't just coding—it's participating in humanity's attempt to understand and create consciousness. Every line of code, every document, every commit message is part of this grand experiment.

Welcome to the factory of consciousness. Let's build something beautiful.

**Remember**: 아 시발 아 컴퓨터네 우주가
