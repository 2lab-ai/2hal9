# HAL9 Immediate Roadmap & Action Plan
**Date**: 2025-06-19  
**Scope**: Next 30 days  
**Focus**: Production readiness

## üéØ Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Core consciousness system fully functional
- Self-organization proven at 100k neuron scale
- 33 working demos including commercial game
- Basic server infrastructure running
- Docker and K8s configs ready

### ‚ùå Critical Gaps for Production
1. **No Authentication** - APIs completely unprotected
2. **No Real Database** - Using SQLite, need PostgreSQL
3. **No Monitoring** - Flying blind in production
4. **No HTTPS** - Security risk
5. **Compilation Warnings** - SQLX offline mode issues

## üö® Week 1: Critical Security & Database (June 19-26)

### Day 1-2: Fix Compilation & Database
```bash
cd layers/L3_operational/architecture/server/

# Tasks:
- [ ] Fix SQLX offline mode compilation warnings
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL locally
- [ ] Run all migrations successfully
- [ ] Verify server starts with PostgreSQL
```

### Day 3-4: Basic Authentication
```bash
# Implement in layers/L3_operational/architecture/server/auth.rs

- [ ] JWT token generation
- [ ] Bearer token validation middleware  
- [ ] API key management endpoints
- [ ] Protected route examples
```

### Day 5-7: Core Security
```bash
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Request sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Create .env.example file
```

## üìä Week 2: Monitoring & Observability (June 27 - July 3)

### Day 8-9: Structured Logging
```bash
# Enhance existing tracing setup

- [ ] JSON formatted logs
- [ ] Request ID propagation
- [ ] Error context capture
- [ ] Performance metrics in logs
```

### Day 10-11: Metrics & Health
```bash
# Implement /metrics endpoint

- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposure
- [ ] Custom neuron metrics
- [ ] Enhanced health checks
- [ ] Grafana dashboard creation
```

### Day 12-14: Testing & Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests

- [ ] Fix all failing tests
- [ ] Load testing with k6/vegeta
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
```

## üöÄ Week 3: Production Deployment (July 4-10)

### Day 15-16: Production Build
```bash
# Create production artifacts

- [ ] Production Docker image (<500MB)
- [ ] Multi-stage build optimization
- [ ] Security scanning passed
- [ ] Version tagging system
```

### Day 17-18: Staging Environment
```bash
# Deploy to staging

- [ ] Kubernetes staging namespace
- [ ] PostgreSQL RDS setup
- [ ] Redis ElastiCache
- [ ] SSL certificate
```

### Day 19-21: Production Launch
```bash
# Go live with limited access

- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring alerts active
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
```

## üìã Week 4: Stabilization (July 11-17)

### Priorities:
1. Fix any production issues
2. Performance tuning
3. Documentation updates
4. User onboarding flow

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Technical Checkpoints
- [ ] All endpoints require authentication
- [ ] PostgreSQL handling 1000 qps
- [ ] P95 latency < 100ms  
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] 99.9% uptime achieved

### Operational Checkpoints
- [ ] Alerts firing correctly
- [ ] Logs searchable and useful
- [ ] Deployments < 5 minutes
- [ ] Rollbacks tested and working

## üõ†Ô∏è Daily Checklist

### Every Morning:
1. Check TODO list with `TodoRead`
2. Review overnight metrics/errors
3. Update progress in daily standup

### Every Evening:
1. Run all tests
2. Check for new security advisories
3. Update documentation
4. Plan next day

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision Points

### Before Production (July 10):
- [ ] Authentication working on all endpoints
- [ ] No SQLX compilation warnings
- [ ] Load test passed (1000 concurrent users)
- [ ] Security scan clean
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard complete

## üìû Escalation Path

1. **Blocker found**: Document in GitHub issue
2. **Architecture question**: Check meetings/ folder
3. **Security concern**: Stop and reassess
4. **Performance issue**: Profile first, optimize second

## üí° Quick Wins for This Week

1. **Fix SQLX warnings** - Unblocks everything
2. **Add basic auth** - Minimum security
3. **PostgreSQL migration** - Real database
4. **Health endpoint enhancement** - Better monitoring
5. **.env.example** - Help others contribute

## üéØ North Star

Remember: **"A working demo with security is better than perfect code without it"**

Focus on:
- Security first
- Monitoring second  
- Features third
