# 🐳 Docker Build Status Report
## Date: 2025-06-17

## Current Status: Building in Progress

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **2hal9-demo Integration**
   - Successfully moved `competitions/genius_game_server` to `../2hal9-demo/crates/genius-games`
   - Deleted temporary `games/` directory (습관성 ADHD fix)
   - Updated workspace configurations

2. **Docker Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created multi-stage Dockerfile with security best practices
   - Configured docker-compose.yml for full stack
   - Created deployment automation script
   - Fixed environment variable handling issues

3. **Performance Optimization Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive performance_optimization.md
   - Documented connection pooling, memory management strategies
   - Set performance targets and monitoring guidelines

### 🔧 Fixes Applied During Build

1. **Rust Version**: Updated from 1.75 → 1.79 → latest (for edition2024 support)
2. **Binary Names**: Fixed hal9-cli → hal9 (actual binary name)
3. **Healthcheck**: Changed from curl to wget (smaller runtime image)
4. **Dockerignore**: Removed Cargo.lock exclusion for reproducible builds
5. **Deploy Script**: Fixed environment variable parsing for comments

### 📊 Docker Stack Configuration

```yaml
Services:
- hal9-server    # Main server (ports 8080, 9090)
- postgres       # Database
- redis          # Cache/Session store
- game-server    # Game server (commented out - needs Dockerfile in 2hal9-demo)
```

### 🚀 Current Build Status

The Docker build is currently in progress, compiling dependencies. This is expected to take 5-10 minutes on first build due to:
- 776 crate dependencies
- Multi-workspace project structure
- Release mode optimization

### 📝 Next Steps After Build Completes

1. **Test Local Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh local
   ```

2. **Verify Services**
   - Check health endpoints
   - Test database connections
   - Verify Redis connectivity

3. **Create CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing
   - Container registry push

### 🎯 Immediate Action Items

Once the build completes:
1. Run the deployment script
2. Verify all services are healthy
3. Test basic functionality
4. Document any issues or improvements needed

### 💡 Lessons Learned

- Always verify Rust version compatibility with dependencies
- Check actual binary names in Cargo.toml files
- Test deployment scripts with proper error handling
- Keep Docker images minimal and secure
