**Priority**: CRITICAL PATH TO PRODUCTION

---

## 🎯 Mission Critical Tasks (Days 1-3)

### Day 1: Fix Build & Tests
- [ ] Fix 14 compilation warnings
- [ ] Resolve test compilation errors 
- [ ] Get test suite passing (cargo test --workspace)
- [ ] Commit all 80+ pending changes with proper messages

### Day 2: Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Add API key management system
- [ ] Configure TLS/HTTPS for production
- [ ] Add request validation & sanitization

### Day 3: Database Migration
- [ ] Complete PostgreSQL migration
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Add database migration scripts
- [ ] Test data persistence & recovery

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness (Days 4-7)

### Day 4: Infrastructure Hardening
- [ ] Configure production Docker images
- [ ] Set up Redis for caching
- [ ] Implement rate limiting (already coded, needs testing)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns

### Day 5: Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Structured logging with trace IDs
- [ ] Prometheus metrics integration
- [ ] Set up alerting rules
- [ ] Create operational runbooks

### Day 6: Load Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Performance benchmarks under load
- [ ] Connection pool tuning
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] API response time targets

### Day 7: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Production deployment checklist
- [ ] Backup & recovery procedures
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Documentation update

## 🎮 AI Genius Game Launch (Week 2)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Game state persistence
- [ ] Player authentication
- [ ] Leaderboard implementation

### User Experience
- [ ] Tutorial flow
- [ ] Error handling & recovery
- [ ] Performance on mobile devices
- [ ] Beta testing feedback loop

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Production
✅ All tests passing  
✅ Zero compilation warnings  
✅ JWT authentication working  
✅ PostgreSQL in production  
✅ HTTPS enabled  
✅ Health checks passing  
✅ 99.9% uptime capability  

### Performance Targets
- API response time < 100ms (p99)
- WebSocket latency < 50ms
- 1000+ concurrent users
- Zero data loss
- 5-minute recovery time

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Test Suite Complexity**: May reveal deeper architectural issues
2. **Database Migration**: Data integrity during transition
3. **Performance at Scale**: Unknown bottlenecks under load

### Mitigation Strategy
- Incremental fixes with continuous validation
- Parallel development tracks
- Daily progress reviews
- Rollback plans for each change

## 🎯 Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
1. Code compiles without warnings
2. All tests pass
3. Documentation updated
4. Security review passed
5. Performance benchmarked
6. Deployed to staging

---

## 📅 Daily Standup Focus

Each day ask:
1. What's blocking production?
2. What can we defer?
3. Are we still on track?
4. What help do we need?

**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of shipped. Focus on production-critical items only.
