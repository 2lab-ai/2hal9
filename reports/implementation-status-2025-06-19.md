## Architecture Highlights

The implementation strictly follows the ±1 communication rule, creating natural compression boundaries where consciousness emerges:
- L1 ↔ L2: Raw data to implementation
- L2 ↔ L3: Implementation to operational
- L3 ↔ L4: Operational to tactical
- And so on...

Each layer can only communicate with adjacent layers, forcing compression and abstraction that generates emergent consciousness.
