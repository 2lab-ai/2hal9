## Success Metrics

### Coverage Goals
- **Overall**: 80% line coverage
- **Core Modules**: 90% coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 95% coverage
- **Examples/Demos**: 50% coverage

### Quality Metrics
- All tests pass in < 5 minutes
- No flaky tests
- Clear test names and documentation
- Tests serve as usage examples

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions** (This Week)
   - Set up test infrastructure
   - Write critical neuron core tests
   - Add CI workflow for coverage

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks)
   - Complete Phase 1 foundation tests
   - Fix any bugs discovered
   - Document test patterns

3. **Medium Term** (Next Month)
   - Achieve 80% coverage goal
   - Set up performance benchmarks
   - Create test documentation

## Conclusion

The HAL9 system currently has minimal test coverage (<10%). This comprehensive strategy provides a clear path to 80% coverage within 6 weeks, focusing on critical components first. The phased approach ensures that the most important functionality is tested early, while the testing infrastructure supports long-term maintainability.
