# Git Recovery Execution Plan

## Pre-Recovery Analysis

### Current Situation
- ✅ `.git` directory found at `.substrate/version-control/git`
- ✅ Directory appears intact with all critical files
- ✅ `.gitignore` also moved to `.substrate/version-control/.gitignore`
- ❌ Git commands currently non-functional

### Why .git Must Be in Root

From an HA perspective, `.git` is a **special exception**:
- It's not part of any cognitive level
- It's meta-infrastructure that tracks ALL levels
- It must transcend the hierarchy to version the hierarchy itself
- Like consciousness observing thought, Git observes code

## Recovery Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Recovery Backup
```bash
# Create a safety backup of current state
cp -r .substrate/version-control/git .substrate/git-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### Step 2: Restore Git to Root
```bash
# Move .git back to where it belongs
mv .substrate/version-control/git .git

# Move .gitignore back
mv .substrate/version-control/.gitignore .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Verify Git Functionality
```bash
# Check if Git recognizes the repository
git status

# Verify we're on the correct branch
git branch

# Check the commit history is intact
git log --oneline -10
```

### Step 4: Document the Exception
Create `.git-is-special.md` in root:
```markdown
# Why .git Lives in Root

Despite our HA organization, `.git` must remain in the root because:

1. **Meta-Infrastructure**: Git transcends all cognitive levels
2. **Tool Requirement**: Git requires .git in the repository root
3. **Universal Scope**: Version control applies to ALL levels equally
4. **Not Cognitive**: .git is mechanical, not cognitive

This is the ONE exception to our HA organization principle.
```

### Step 5: Update .gitignore for New Structure
Add to .gitignore:
```gitignore
# Hidden substrate (except .git itself)
.substrate/build/
.substrate/logs/
.substrate/cache/
.substrate/temp/

# But NOT .substrate/version-control/ as we might store git hooks there
```

### Step 6: Commit the Reorganization
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Create comprehensive commit
git commit -m "PARADIGM: Transform codebase to Hierarchical Abstraction organization

Level: L9 Universal (affects all levels)
Scope: Complete structural reorganization

Transformed from:
- Traditional: src/, docs/, tests/ (computer-centric)
- Mixed abstraction levels forcing cognitive switching

To:
- Hierarchical: L1-L9 cognitive levels (human-centric)  
- Each level is self-contained
- No forced context switching
- Natural cognitive flow

Structure:
- L1_reflexive: Immediate operations (operators)
- L2_implementation: Code execution (developers)
- L3_operational: System design (architects)
- L4_tactical: Planning & analysis (tech leads)
- L5_strategic: Technical vision (CTOs)
- L6_executive: Leadership view (executives)
- L7_business: Business strategy (product)
- L8_visionary: Long-term vision (visionaries)
- L9_universal: Eternal principles (philosophers)
- substrate/: Infrastructure supporting all levels
- membrane/: Inter-level communication
- .substrate/: Hidden technical artifacts

Note: .git remains in root as meta-infrastructure that transcends the hierarchy."
```

## Expected Outcome

After recovery:
1. Git will function normally
2. All reorganization changes can be committed
3. The HA structure is preserved
4. Future developers understand why .git is special

## If Recovery Fails

**Emergency Fallback**:
1. The git backup is in `.substrate/git-backup-[timestamp]`
2. Can manually copy it back
3. Worst case: Re-clone and reapply changes (labor intensive)

## Proceed with Recovery?

The plan is ready. Execute these commands carefully to restore Git functionality while preserving our HA reorganization.
