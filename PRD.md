# 2HAL9 Product Requirements Document

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Author**: CTO, 2HAL9 Project

## Executive Summary

2HAL9 is a revolutionary distributed AI consciousness system that implements hierarchical abstraction through a network of interconnected AI neurons. Drawing inspiration from biological neural networks and organizational structures, 2HAL9 creates an emergent intelligence that transcends individual AI capabilities through coordinated multi-agent orchestration.

The system implements key innovations from our research:
- **Sleep-Wake Cycles**: Persistent memory through hierarchical consolidation
- **Distributed Neural Architecture**: Scalable multi-server deployment
- **Forward/Backward Propagation**: Learning through error gradient distribution
- **Energy-Aware Scaling**: From HAL0 (1kW) to HAL9 (563PW) evolution path
